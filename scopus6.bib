	abstract = {Purpose: The emerging concept of smart city is known to aim at sustainable urban development. One of the requirements for a smart city is to address accessibility inequalities. This study aims to investigate the accessibility level issues in urban transformation before and after combining different street networks for Penang, Malaysia, as a case study to reveal greater insight and helpful information into mobility and accessibility inequalities for future smart city planning. Design/methodology/approach: Using DepthmapX software, two main quantitative methodologies of space syntax, namely, spatial integration accessibility (SIA) and angular segment analysis by metric distance (ASDMA), are employed to analyse the level of accessibility for the main streets of George Town site before and after combination with contemporary networks. Integration, choice and entropy values were calculated for the study analysis. Findings: Results revealed the implications of combining old irregular gridiron structures with the existing planned grid structures. George Town seems to have gained a higher capacity for pedestrian accessibility; however, vehicle accessibility has lost its capacity. Findings further suggest that a combination of irregular structure and grid structure is essential for urban growth in similar historical contexts to improve accessibility and address mobility inequalities. Originality/value: The study concludes by highlighting the importance of the analysis of street structure transformation to predict consequences and promote the potential to reduce current inequalities in vehicle accessibility. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Urban carbon emissions lead to increases in global carbon emissions; consequently, meeting targets for low carbon emissions is a difficult problem in the context of urbanization. Improving urban carbon emissions efficiency (UCEE) in the new-type urbanization (NTU) process is key to reducing urban carbon and enhancing sustainable urban development. However, the potential of NTU in facilitating improved UCEE remains unclear. Thus, we investigated the effect and transmission mechanisms of NTU on UCEE in China. A set of spatial econometric models was used, with panel data from 283 cities across China from 2006 to 2019. The results showed that NTU significantly promoted the improvement of UCEE, and UCEE improved strongly during the later stage of NTU construction. In China's central and western cities, large cities, and non-natural resource–based cities, the promotion effect of NTU on UCEE was more significant. Overall, the economic agglomeration effect had the most significant influence, followed by the government leading effect and resource allocation effect. Moreover, the NTU pilot policies of civilized city, low-carbon city, innovative city, smart city, and green finance city significantly promoted the improvement of UCEE. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence for the effective achievement of the “dual carbon” goal with respect to NTU in China. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The demand for apparel/fashion products is usually of heavy weather-related uncertainty, which can be solved by the publicly accessible weather information provided by the government. That is because weather information provides a more accurate demand signal, and the key weather indicators fashion brand, the latter determines the wholesale price but usually postpones the price decision to observe the weather information. Alternatively, the small retailer can outsource procurement to a powerful agent, who fixes the fashion brand's wholesale price. In this article, we investigate an apparel supply chain consisting of two competing small retailers (retailers 1 and 2), a powerful procurement agent, and a famous fashion brand. Given retailer 2's procurement outsourcing, retailer 1 decides whether to outsource procurement to the agent or directly procure products from the fashion brand. We identify cooperation and competition relationships in the retailers' ordering decisions based on the weather information. The different intensities of the cooperation/competition relationships alter retailer 1's preferences of procurement outsourcing because of the mitigated/intensified quantity competition. Interestingly, we show that, when demand uncertainty is high, retailer 1's procurement outsourcing strategy will switch from Turnkey to Consignment and back to Turnkey, as its demand becomes more sensitive to the weather condition.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the production of stone paper, in addition to its widespread utilization in various fields, does not require water consumption, cutting down trees, and stone paper products are easily recyclable and recoverable. Due to the importance of developing and using stone paper and paying attention to environmental matters, Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network Design (CLSCND) is very important for stone paper products. Moreover, due to epistemic, randomness uncertainties, the uncertainties in Objective Function (OF), and the flexible constraints for CLSCND in the real world, this paper introduces a novel Mixed Robust Stochastic, Possibilistic, and Flexible Programming (MRSPFP) approach based on credibility theory. The different attitudes of the Decision-Makers (DMs) are addressed by a more flexible measurement of the optimistic and pessimistic parameters using the criterion of credibility. In the study, a comprehensive procedure is proposed for stone paper CLSCND, to minimize costs, increase responsiveness by minimizing transit time between different facilities, and regarding environmental concerns into account through minimizing carbon emissions. The model is solved utilizing an interactive fuzzy programming solution procedure and the Best-Worst Method (BWM). The results of sensitivity analysis, the effect of changing the problem parameters, and the performance of the proposed model are investigated and compared. The results show that the MRSPFP model has a better performance compared to other previous models. The MRSPFP model performs better in strategic decisions that require high investment costs due to the minimization of the absolute deviation of OF from its mean. Also, the applied results of the study show that CLSCND has a good capability and potential for sustainable development in the field of stone paper. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Comparing pre and peri-pandemic patronage, we identify pronounced social and spatial inequalities in the speed of return to public transport. We find that male, younger and non-White passengers are more likely to return to public transport as soon as movement restrictions were lifted, whereas passengers from White ethnic background and affluent areas do not return to public transport within the first year after the outbreak. Pronounced social inequalities persist into the middle of 2021, and only thence they began to attenuate as part of a wider return to public transport among passengers post retirement age. In 2022, 80% of these passengers have returned to public transport but the frequency of use has remained lower than prior to the pandemic. We discuss implications for transport policy and planning. © 2023},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to identify the pandemic’s impact on house rents by applying a rental gradient analysis to compare the pre-and post-COVID-19 periods in Auckland. The micro-level household census data from the Integrated Data Infrastructure of Statistics New Zealand is also applied to scrutinise this WFH trend as a robustness check. Design/methodology/approach: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, work-from-home (WFH) and e-commerce have become much more common in many cities. Many news reports have contended that households are leaving city centres and moving into bigger and better houses in the suburbs or rural areas. This emerging trend has been redefining the traditional theory of residential location choices. Proximity to central business district (CBD) is no longer the most critical consideration in choosing one’s residence. WFH and e-commerce flatten the traditional bid rent curve from the city centre. Findings: The authors examined micro-level housing rental listings in 242 suburbs of the Auckland Region from January 2013 to December 2021 (108 months) and found that the hedonic price gradient models suggest that there has been a trend of rental gradient flattening and that its extent was almost doubled in 2021. Rents are also found to be increasing more in lower-density suburbs. Research limitations/implications: The results imply that the pandemic has accelerated the trend of WFH and e-commerce. The authors further discuss whether the trend will be a transient phenomenon or a long-term shift. Practical implications: Suppose an organisation is concerned about productivity and performance issues due to a companywide ability to WFH. In that case, some standard key performance indicators for management and employees could be implemented. Forward-thinking cities need to focus on attracting skilful workers by making WFH a possible solution, not by insisting on the primacy of antiquated nine-to-five office cultures. Social implications: WFH has traditionally encountered resistance, but more and more companies are adopting WFH policies in this post-COVID era. The early rental gradient and the micro-level household data analysis all confirm that the WFH trend is emerging and will likely be a long-term shift. Instead of resisting the change, organisations should improve their remote work policies and capabilities for this WFH trend. Originality/value: So far, empirical studies of post-COVID urban restructuring have been limited. This study aims to empirically test such an urban metamorphosis by identifying the spatial and temporal impacts of COVID on house rental gradients in the Auckland Region, New Zealand. The authors apply rental gradient analysis to test this urban restructuring hypothesis because the method considers the spatial-temporal differences, i.e. a difference-in-differences between pre-and post-pandemic period against the distance measured from the city centre. The method can control for the spatial difference and the endogeneity involved. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Several cities worldwide have been attempting to adopt “car-lite” policies to reduce traffic congestion and urban pollution. In addition to measures such as re-designing neighbourhoods and encouraging active modes, much expectation has been placed on the adoption of new and innovative modes, particularly shared AVs, or Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMOD). Although the realisation of AMOD appears to be imminent, little is known about its potential effects on current transport systems. In this paper, using SimMobility, an agent-based microsimulation platform, we explored the impact of AMOD on public transport (PT). Two AV adoption scenarios were simulated: (1) “Partial Automation” where AMOD is introduced alongside existing modes, and (2) “Full Automation” where the use of private human-driven vehicles is prohibited upon the implementation of AMOD. We found that, compared to the base case (where there is no AMOD), the share of PT usage increased significantly in the AMODscenarios. While the overall congestion level was reduced in the Full Automation scenario, road in the Partial Automation scenario tended to suffer from high travel demand. The increased demand for PT also prompts for a revision of current service schedules. The temporal and spatial analyses of PT demand between scenarios have brought some useful implications on the implementation of AMOD for urban and transport planners. © 2023 The Authors},

The Afram Plains in Ghana, despite been touted as the food basket of the country, has long struggled with poor spatial accessibility due to the lack of reliable transport infrastructure. This problem negatively impacts the movement of people and products, which ultimately hinders the economic development of the area. This research aimed at capturing the perspectives of Afram Plains’ residents regarding their spatial access to nearby markets. A mixed-method approach comprising survey questionnaire, interviews, and geographic information system (GIS) was utilized. The results affirmed that movement within the area, particularly to market, is difficult. Again, due to limited transport facilities, many people resort to walking as their primary means of transportation. These findings are expected to provide some vital ideas for future road planning in the area. © 2023 IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Understanding the effect of neighborhood facilities on older adults' participation in hobbies and sports activities can provide solid evidence for effective health promotion policies. However, few studies have considered the relationship between the geographic accessibility of neighborhood facilities and their degree of spatial clustering with changes in group participation over time. This study examined whether the geographical distribution of neighborhood facilities—their geographic accessibility and degree of spatial clustering—can facilitate older adults' group participation. Longitudinal data of 20,151 older adults living in 339 elementary school districts were collected through the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study. The findings within the Japanese context show that high geographic accessibility of neighborhood facilities and their spatially clustered patterns are related to an increase in group participation. Meanwhile, for older adults who have close ties with neighbors, an increase in sports group participation can be negatively impacted despite the great geographic accessibility to city parks. Spatially dispersed eating facilities are also related to good relationships with neighbors, facilitating participation in sports groups. Therefore, policymakers should carefully consider the various dynamics in the effect when discussing the choice of facility location to facilitate older adults' participation in hobbies and sports groups. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This study aimed to investigate the matter of gender inequality in relation to the privacy protection created in the spatial configuration of urban furniture based on a case study of Rasht, Iran. To achieve this end, the framework of gender equality in relation to privacy protection in the use of urban furniture was established with respect to various physical, social and cultural dimensions. Accordingly, a mixture of methods, including a questionnaire and quantitative methods using space syntax, was adopted for this empirical study. Unlike the previous literature that has considered the profound impact of Islamic principles on the privacy demands of Muslim citizens, the present research suggests that religious principles do not have a notable influence on the privacy demands of men and women within a Muslim community. Moreover, the present study found that privacy demands can be a universal phenomenon with the ability to reflect cultural and contextual particularities. The results also suggest that men and women diverge significantly in their privacy demands, and that the provision of gender equality in privacy protection will facilitate the establishment of social justice and fair interactions within a Muslim society. The implications of this research can be considered as a guideline for implementing the goals of social justice and sustainability within urban spaces in Muslim settings. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {We propose the ideal (perfect, radial) isochrone and use it to develop indicators for the assessment of the spatio-temporal efficiency of transport systems for use in urban planning and business location decisions. The ideal isochrone is a circle in geographical space with a radius that results from unimpeded movement in all directions based on uniform, uninterrupted speed. In this way, concentric isochrones are centered at the beginning of a route and with radii corresponding to the time needed to overcome it. The ideal isochrone is a benchmark for real (actual) isochrones, associated with moving in realistic conditions using different transport modes. In this way, it is possible to determine the whole family of indicators based on comparisons of individual types of isochrones with respect to each other. The second part of the article illustrates this with relevant empirical examples. The proposed indicators and solutions may be used particularly in assessing the spatio-temporal efficiency of transport systems for various methods and forms of mobility both in the public and private sectors. Therefore, their use can be recommended for practical purposes of transport and spatial policy as well as public and commercial management, to assess current and future access to destinations. Better access means higher spatial equity in the urban planning sense and more customers and higher land value in the business sense. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The sustainable development goals (SDGs) reflect the pursuit of achieving spatial justice. Both SDG 1.4 and SDG 11.1 reflect a concern for urban services. Life service resources, which are the new concept proposed by the Chinese government, also call for sustainable development path. However, few studies have focused on the realization of spatial justice in life service resources. This paper proposes a two-level, four-step analysis framework composed of quantity, structure, pattern, and coupling coordination to perceive the spatial justice of life service resources. Based on remote sensing technology and geographic information science, this paper acquires and analyses multi-source data including population density, building outlines, point of interests, subway lines, etc. Furthermore, the case study in downtown Beijing found the following: (1) The total life service resources are extensive and varying in type; (2) regional differences are evident and low-level equilibrium and high-level priority development coexist; (3) life service resources are concentrated in contiguous and multi-centre clusters with a greater north–south than east–west difference; (4) the overall level of life service resources is low, specifically for “high in the centre and low in the periphery” and “high in the east and low in the west”. Future management should consider narrowing the development gap and formulating industry development plans to improve spatial justice. Finally, the comparison between Beijing and London and more cities in the future needs to consider the urban development stage, population density, and other aspects. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Humanity has faced many pandemics throughout its history with COVID-19 pandemic being the most recent. Each pandemic requires the implementation of a series of restrictions and measures to reform local societies or even society on a global scale. Scientific and technological innovations have ensured the survival of mankind and consequently the establishment of new habits and trends. One of these reforms concerns the transport of goods and in particular urban logistics and last-mile delivery. Despite the increasing use of e-commerce, the average amount of money spent per month and per buyer has decreased; in times of uncertainty, people prefer to postpone big purchases and focus more on everyday products. These purchases have generated an increase in demand for the transport of goods and put significant pressure on the supply chain. For this reason, actions have been developed to improve logistics, in particular last-mile delivery, with the introduction of environmentally friendly and small vehicles, among others. In order to be able to trace the evolution of the combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and logistics spatially and temporally, the manuscript focused as a first step on the analysis of the literature entered in the main databases dedicated to scientific publications, returning some 2,227 indexed articles from 2000 to 2021. The search was conducted using keywords and iterations between them. The results emphasised the need to adapt business activities to the changing situation by anticipating people's needs, creating e-commerce sites capable of accompanying customers in this delicate phase. The results obtained were analysed from a statistical point of view, laying the foundations for future investigative steps in the field of last-mile logistics and the proper planning of loading and unloading spaces for goods in urban areas. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Urban public transport services offer mobility opportunities to people who do not have a private car or other means of travel. This crucial public service can, therefore, only fulfil its mission if it is equitably available throughout the city and for all populations, and if it functions efficiently. This research aims to test the hypothesis that the problem of inequalities in access to public transport services in Algiers is mainly due to a bad spatial configuration of the bus network and an unbalanced distribution of the public transport offer. A methodological approach that combines data analysis by classification and geospatial analysis is used by the author. The analyses showed that there is an inequality in the spatial distribution of the supply of the public transport network combined with a poorer performance of the public transport system in the peripheral municipalities, where there is a lack of basic infrastructure, which increases the risk of exclusion of the poorest populations. The Algiers Urban Transport Authority should take passengers’ expectations into account in the decision-making process, as well as in the establishment of transport plans and in the definition of quality indicator requirements for bus service operators eligible for the activity. In addition, information and communication technologies can be used to optimize the efficiency of the public transport system by making travel information readily available and accessible to users. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Previous studies on SSFs mainly focused on their application in commercial or other scenarios. However, SSFs in residential areas have not been thoroughly studied. This study develops an analytical framework for assessing both the supply and demand for SSFs in residential areas. The study evaluates 2693 residential communities and 479 smart parcel lockers (SPLs) in Tianjin, China. The results show that the high-demand area for SPLs is within 300 m of home, while the high-supply area is 300–600 m from home. Further analysis using the Gini coefficient and location quotient shows that the top 20% of the population have access to 80% of SPLs, and most residential communities experience an oversupply. Our study suggests that a mismatch between the supply and demand of SPLs may result in massive public space waste, resource waste, and inequity. Given the many uncertainties of the future, this study highlights the need to consider the dynamic supply–demand relationship of SSFs. This may encourage urban planners, policymakers, and experts in other related disciplines to work towards a more service-efficient and equitable utilization of SSFs in residential areas. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in e-commerce, which has prompted residents to shift their purchasing habits from offline to online. As a result, Smart Parcel Lockers (SPLs) have emerged as an accessible end-to-end delivery service that fits into the pandemic strategy of maintaining social distance and no-contact protocols. Although numerous studies have examined SPLs from various perspectives, few have analyzed their spatial distribution from an urban planning perspective, which could enhance the development of other disciplines in this field. To address this gap, we investigate the distribution of SPLs in Tianjin’s central urban area before and after the pandemic (i.e., 2019 and 2022) using kernel density estimation, average nearest neighbor analysis, standard deviation elliptic, and geographical detector. Our results show that, in three years, the number of SPLs has increased from 51 to 479, and a majority were installed in residential communities (i.e., 92.2% in 2019, and 97.7% in 2022). We find that SPLs were distributed randomly before the pandemic, but after the pandemic, SPLs agglomerated and followed Tianjin’s development pattern. We identify eight influential factors on the spatial distribution of SPLs and discuss their individual and compound effects. Our discussion highlights potential spatial distribution analysis, such as dynamic layout planning, to improve the allocation of SPLs in city planning and city logistics. © 2023 by the authors.},

The resources include parks, urban greenery, and private facilities for recreation to name a few. Although morphological indicators such as street connectivity, block size, and block length are important for walking, limited literature explains how these built forms vary for neighborhoods of different socio-economic groups. The study can be important in Indian conditions since walking is a necessity for work as well as for leisure for a certain group of people who cannot afford to buy motorized vehicles. Assessing spatial inequality for them can contribute to recommendations for sustainable planning. This study compares four neighborhoods of different property values in Bhubaneswar, India to examine the inequality in the built-form distribution. India is specially chosen for this study because standard rules for subdivisions are almost missing there. Seven built-form indicators are compared for the four neighborhoods. The analysis shows that a variation in built form does exist between neighborhoods of different socio-economic groups. Longer blocks, higher block density, and higher plot density are observed for neighborhood of lower socio-economic status. However, neighborhood predominated by informal housing is compact and found to have the best walkability conditions. © This open access article is published under a Creative Commons [Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International] license.},

	abstract = {In several publications between 1998 and 2003, Elizabeth Burton examined whether urban compactness promotes social equity. Based on an extensive literature review, Burton developed numerous urban compactness and social equity measures. Using a sample of 25 free-standing English cities of different sizes, her studies found that urban compactness measures are often statistically correlated with social equity measures in these cities. Extending Burton’s studies, this study explores the correlations between the measures of street networks, urban compactness, and social equity in the same 25 cities that Burton studied. Correlational analyses revealed that street network measures are correlated differently with different urban compactness and social equity measures. Some street network measures are not statistically correlated with social equity and urban compactness measures. Some are statistically correlated with urban compactness measures, but not with social equity measures. Yet others are statistically correlated with social equity measures, but not with urban compactness. Still others are statistically correlated with both social equity and urban compactness measures. Therefore, it was concluded that spatial mechanisms may work differently for different aspects of social equity. The implications of these findings are discussed. © 2022 by the author.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate acquisition and mobility experiences of food-insecure individuals across urbanicity levels (i.e., urban, suburban, rural) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional study using a nationally representative online panel to measure where food-insecure individuals acquired food, food acquisition barriers and mobility to food sources, which were evaluated across urbanicity levels using chi-squared tests and 95 % CI. Setting: USA. Participants: 2011 adults (18 years or older). Results: Food insecurity impacted 62·3 % of adults in urban areas, 40·5 % in rural areas and 36·7 % in suburban areas (P < 0·001). Food acquisition barriers that were significantly more prevalent among food-insecure adults in urban areas were a change in employment status (34·2 %; 95 % CI 27·2 %, 41·1 %; P < 0·0001) and limited availability of food in retailers (38·8 %; 95 % CI 31·7 %, 45·9 %; P < 0·001). In rural areas, food-insecure adults primarily acquired food for the household from supercentres (61·5 %; 95 % CI 50·4 %, 72·5 %; P < 0·05), while locally sourced foods were less common among food-insecure adults in rural areas (6·9 %; 95 % CI 0·01 %, 13·0 %) compared to urban areas (19·8 %; 95 % CI 14·3 %, 25·4 %; P < 0·01). Transportation as a barrier did not vary significantly by urbanicity, but food-insecure adults across urbanicity levels reported utilising a range of transportation modes to acquire food. Conclusions: A planning approach that links urban and rural areas could address food insecurity by enhancing the integration of food production, transportation and food distribution, building towards a more resilient and equitable food system for all Americans.  © },

However, little is known about how and why these ads generate brand engagement. This study fills this gap. This paper indicates that two important features of location-based advertising (LBA)—location congruency and personalization—influence brand engagement and that the underlying mechanism behind this relationship is consumer brand identification. Further, it shows it is not only the personalization feature of these ads that increases its effectiveness, but the ad should also be location-congruent to make it effective. The conceptual model is tested by manipulating location-congruency and personalization features of LBA in two different contexts. This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence that LBA increases brand engagement and to uncover the theoretical mechanism of this relationship. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

This study assesses the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and the number of urban e-commerce deliveries using negative binomial regression models applied to Belo Horizonte, Brazil data. The number of e-commerce deliveries between 2019 and 2021 was modeled considering the number of retail shops, sociodemographic data, and neighborhood area. The results show that income, number of retail shops, and neighborhood land area positively influence e-commerce deliveries, while household size negatively impacts the number of deliveries. The elasticity values and t-test indicate that the impact of different characteristics changed in 2020, remaining similar between 2019 and 2021. Income was the most impactful variable in the number of deliveries in 2020.

	abstract = {Driven by the change in intense land use and land cover (LULC) due to fast urbanization, urban flooding events have become the most frequent and influential hazards over the last few decades. Accurately predicting possible flood-prone locations under the dynamic fluctuations of LULC is crucial for sustainable urban development. However, there has been sparse studies on systematic integration of LULC changes into anticipate urban development scenarios coupled with flooding vulnerability assessment. Therefore, this study proposed a robust and powerful cascade modeling chain consisting of Maximum Entropy, System Dynamics and Patch-generating Land Use Simulation in combination with shared socio-economic pathways for projecting temporal and spatial dynamic changes associated with urban flooding vulnerability. Taking Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) as case study, the results showed that the increase in urban flooding was largely caused by the expansion of construction land. Overall, a substantial distinction within the scenarios was observed and the flooding vulnerability was ranked in the order of SSP126 < SSP245 < SSP585. Under SSP585, the areas with high flooding risk will be expected to increase significantly, accounting for 26% of the total areas, and nearly half of the built-up areas are exposed to flooding risk by 2050. Under SSP245, the built-up areas exposed to medium and high flooding risk were anticipated to cover nearly a fifth of the total areas. Under SSP126 scenario, nearly no change was predicted in the area with high flooding risk, with only increase of 1%, future urbanization hotspots associated with serious flooding risks will likely to be found on the fringe of the GBA's construction areas, in line with the extent of construction land expansion. The finding of this study will shed a comprehensive insight into the identification of spatial and temporal distribution of urban flooding vulnerability to facilitate the exploration of flood mitigation measures associated with dynamic changes in urban land use. © 2023 The Author(s)},

This study aims to rigorously evaluate urban accessibility by scrutinizing established criteria and measurement approaches within the literature. A systematic literature review was executed, targeting articles selected for their pertinence and citation impact. Through meticulous analysis, four cardinal indicators of access and their respective subsets were distilled. Synthesizing data from 61 scholarly publications elucidated the key indicators of accessibility. The findings underscore the adaptability and utility of these criteria as evaluative instruments and in guiding policy decisions. On the other hand, availability and quality of data, greater attention to travel reliability and user preferences are among the factors that should be considered in the accessibility assessment. The study's insights advocate for a nuanced application of accessibility indicators, promoting their evolution as multifaceted tools in urban planning domains. These results serve as a foundation for future research and contribute to the refinement of methods for comprehensive accessibility analysis in urban settings. Copyright: ©2023 IIETA.

	abstract = {Purpose: Although considerable evidence shows that online product reviews (OPRs) can greatly affect consumers, how interface designs of OPR systems (i.e. websites where consumers read and write OPRs) impact online buying behavior has not yet been well investigated. Using research on confidence in judgment and the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) framework, this study aims to develop a model of the effects of OPR system design on consumer purchase behavior. Design/methodology/approach: A study using a two by two by two factorial experimental design was conducted. The structural model with AMOS 23 based on 319 useable data points was tested. Findings: Findings are very interesting. First, designs that manipulate positions of reviews impact perceived value but surprisingly have no effects on confidence in judgment. Second, designs using default display order based on helpfulness votes rather than on recency of reviews increase confidence to a higher level. Third, although unstructured organization methods are used by many major OPR systems, they are inferior in enhancing consumers’ emotional reactions to structured ones. Research limitations/implications: This paper highlights the need for more academic research on how interface designs of online product review systems impact purchase behavior. Additionally, this study emphasizes the need for examining how confidence in judgment is impacted in the online environment. Practical implications: For practitioners, this research provides them with design implications on how to increase consumer purchase behavior. Originality/value: This research enhances the understanding of the effects of OPR system interface design on purchase behavior. In addition, the current paper sheds light on how confidence in judgment, given its importance in reducing online consumer’s hesitance to buy, is impacted by various interface designs of OPR systems. Furthermore, this study applies the SOR framework to the context of OPR system designs. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {As the progress of reform and opening up, the urbanization in China has experienced extensional and extensive development mode. However, the development model is not sustainable. Considering that urban agglomeration is the main form for promoting the future urbanization, the construction of smart urban agglomeration has become the research focus. The lack of theoretical guidance will lead to certain blindness in construction of smart urban agglomeration. Therefore, this paper aims to build up a theoretical framework for the construction of smart urban agglomeration under the system of "One Connection and Ecological-Living-Production Space System" through the cognition of the essence of "smart" as well as urban agglomeration. The results show that: (1) The construction of smart cities and smart urban agglomeration cannot be separated from the soul guidance of a community of life. Therefore, based on the comprehensive cognition of "wisdom" in psychology, it is proposed that the soul of a smart city shall be oriented to the self-regulation for people oriented, including real-time smart perception, smart assessment, smart optimization, and smart implementation; (2) "Interconnection, Production, Life, and Ecology" (One Connection and Ecological-Living-Production Space System) are the four major sections of spatial systems of smart urban agglomeration; (3) Fulfillment of smart perception, smart assessment, and smart optimization in "One Connection and Ecological-Living-Production Space System" is the core of constructing smart urban agglomeration. Meanwhile, combined with the actual situation of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), the objective and content of constructing GBA urban agglomerations are further studied. In addition, the supporting role of geospatial information technology in GBA urban agglomeration is discussed so as to provide reference for the establishment of theoretical framework of constructing smart urban agglomerations in China. © 2022, Science Press.

	abstract = {This study is grounded in the coordinated development of the “transportation-urban vitality” coupling in county-level spaces within urban agglomerations. The research object is the Lanzhou–Xining urban agglomeration, a typical western region in China. The interactive relationship between the transportation network of county-level cities within the urban agglomeration and urban vitality is selected, and the vitality evaluation model and spatial syntax model are used to measure the functional vitality, socioeconomic vitality, and transportation network accessibility of the urban agglomeration. On this basis, the evolution characteristics of the coupling coordination level between the transportation network and the urban vitality of the Lanzhou–Xining urban agglomeration are studied. The research found that over the past decade, the transportation network accessibility of the Lanzhou–Xining urban agglomeration and the vitality of the nodal cities have significantly increased. However, the internal development of the urban agglomeration needs to be more balanced. The dual core-driven urban agglomeration has formed a distinct “ridge line” connection, but the polarization phenomenon caused by the “core-periphery” structure is still prominent. The coupling coordination level of spatial development in the county-level space of the Lanzhou–Xining urban agglomeration varies greatly, with approximately 80% of the county-level cities still in a state of imbalance, leading to a mismatch between the transportation network and urban vitality of the Lanzhou–Xining urban agglomeration.

We investigate the effect of interactivity of brands' marketing activities on Facebook fan pages on continuous participation (i.e., commenting and sharing) intentions. The S–O-R (stimulus-organism-response) framework is used to examine consumers' psychological states (perceived brand fan page experience and attachment) and subsequent behavioral responses (continuous participation intentions) after being stimulated (social media marketing activity interactivity). Using an online questionnaire, this study surveyed the top 15 brands' Facebook fan page users worldwide. We obtained 216 valid responses and used partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the data. Results show that the more interactive a brand's marketing activities are on its Facebook fan page, the higher the perceived experience. In addition, perceived experience positively affects brand fan page attachment. Perceived experience and brand fan page attachment positively affect continuous participation intentions. Perceived experience partially mediated the relationship between interactivity and continuous participation intentions. Brand fan page attachment also partially mediated the relationship between perceived experience and continuous participation intentions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study addresses the crucial question of the macroeconomic impact of investing in railroad infrastructure in Portugal. The aim is to shed light on the immediate and long-term effects of such investments on economic output, employment, and private investment, specifically focusing on interindustry variations. We employ a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model and utilize industry-level data to estimate elasticities and marginal products on these three economic indicators. Our findings reveal a compelling positive long-term spillover effect of these investments. Specifically, every €1 million in capital spending results in a €20.84 million increase in GDP, a €17.78 million boost in private investment, and 72 new net permanent jobs. However, these gains are not immediate, as only 14.5% of the output increase and 38.8% of the investment surge occur in the first year. In contrast, job creation is nearly instantaneous, with 93% of new jobs materializing within the first year. A short-term negative impact on the trade balance is expected as new capital goods are imported. Upon industry-level analysis, the most pronounced output increases are witnessed in the real estate, construction, and wholesale and retail trade industries. The most substantial net job creation occurs in the construction, professional services, and hospitality industries. This study enriches the empirical literature by uncovering industry-specific impacts and temporal macroeconomic effects of railroad infrastructure investments. This underscores their dual advantage in bolstering long-term economic performance and counteracting job losses during downturns, thus offering valuable public policy implications. Notably, these benefits are not evenly distributed across all industries, necessitating strategic sectoral planning and awareness of employment agencies to optimize spending programs and adapt to industry shifts. © 2023 by author(s).},

However, scientific literature predominantly focuses on charging infrastructure design, overlooking the importance of pricing strategies that can optimize their utilization. To address this gap, this study presents an integrated incentive scheme aimed at maximizing system utilization by effectively distributing the charging demand across stations. Moreover, a novel concept of Flex Accessible Charging Points (FLEX-ACP) is introduced, specifically designed to enhance accessibility and reduce waiting time for users with disabilities and seniors (UDS). The proposed framework utilizes an optimal charging network configuration, considering the number and locations of charging facilities, and then determines appropriate incentives at each station to minimize total waiting time. The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization model, which is subsequently transformed into a single-level mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). To solve this program, a combination of heuristic and branch-and-cut algorithms is employed. The developed models are tested through a realistic case study, utilizing real-world data from Salt Lake County in Utah. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Previous studies have largely ignored transport network effects and spillovers on intra-metropolitan employment growth. In this paper, we incorporate transport network analysis and spatial econometric techniques to examine the impact of transport accessibility on local employment growth in the Beijing metropolitan area from 1996 to 2018. Our results indicate significant positive transport network effects and the existence of spatial spillovers of transport accessibility on intra-metropolitan employment growth. As for the spatial spillovers, we argue that whether the spillovers of transport accessibility on nearby areas are positive or negative depends on the spatial scale and the types of economic activities and transport infrastructure. Our results show that the spillovers of highways are negative at the relatively small spatial scale and mainly for sectors with intensive demand for transport services, while rail transit imposes positive spillovers on the economy of regions around rail transit at the larger spatial scale and mainly for higher-order services. © 2023 Urban Affairs Association.},

A comprehensive modeling framework has been devised to predict alterations in shopping behavior, generate future synthesized populations for major metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), and estimate parameters associated with shopping travel and last-mile delivery alternatives. This framework relies on an integrated simulation that produces shopping and delivery travel, incorporating techniques such as Weighted Multinomial Logit and Monte Carlo simulation. The findings reveal that population growth and socio-demographic factors will differentially impact shopping behaviors across various MSAs. Furthermore, shopping travel and delivery patterns are subject to the influence of the spatial distribution of trips and transportation mode selection.

	abstract = {Using a parsimonious model, this paper analyzes a dockless bike-sharing (DLB) service that competes with walking and a generic motorized mode. The DLB operator chooses a fleet size and a fare schedule that dictate the level of service (LOS) as measured by the access time or the walking time taken to reach the nearest bike location. The market equilibrium is formulated as a solution to a nonlinear equation system over which three counterfactual design problems are defined to maximize (i) profit, (ii) ridership, or (iii) social welfare. The model is calibrated with empirical data collected in Chengdu, China, and all three counterfactual designs are tested against the status quo. We show the LOS of a DLB system is subject to rapidly diminishing returns to the investment on the fleet. Thus, under the monopoly setting considered herein, the current fleet cap set by Chengdu can be cut by up to three quarters even when the DLB operator aims to maximize ridership. This indicates the city’s fleet cap decision might have been misguided by the prevailing conditions of a competitive yet highly inefficient market. For a regulator seeking to influence the DLB operator for social good, the choice of policy instruments depends on the operator’s objective. When the operator focuses on profit, limiting fare is much more effective than limiting fleet size. If, instead, it aims to grow market share, then setting a limit on fleet size becomes a dominant strategy. We also show, both analytically and numerically, that the ability to achieve a stable LOS with a low rebalancing frequency is critical to profitability. A lower rebalancing frequency always rewards users with cheaper fares and better LOS even for a profit-maximizing operator. © 2023 INFORMS.},

Therefore, climate finance institutions and national decision-makers face difficult trade-offs when allocating funds. While not a substitute for expert judgement, we argue that understanding how the public thinks could play a role in building support. Using a representative sample of the UK population, we use a discrete choice experiment to explore in particular the way in which distributional considerations drive respondent decisions in two dimensions: (a) among recipients of adaptation finance in recipient developing countries, and (b) among those who contribute to this finance (via taxation). We categorise our results as follows. First, respondents show strong distributional preferences for funds to reach the poorest individuals, supporting adoption of egalitarian policy mandates among climate adaptation funds. Secondly, respondents prefer an ‘ability-to-pay’ approach over the ‘polluter-pays-principle’ as a way of funding. Thirdly, our results suggest that a focus on communicating future benefits to UK residents can increase policy support. Overall, however, our findings also reveal that public support for global climate adaptation payments is insufficient. Yet we provide means of understanding how to allocate all-too-scarce funds and how to increase support for adaptation finance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Big data provide the opportunity to explore behaviours at the population level. We used data collected from Flipp, a free all-in-one savings and deals content app, to identify visitation to grocery stores and estimate home-to-store distances, monthly frequencies and number of unique stores visited in eight Canadian cities during 2020. Grocery shopping outcomes and associations with income, population density and percentage of car commuters were explored using data aggregated at the Aggregate Dissemination Area level in which app users lived. Changes in patterns of grocery shopping following restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were also investigated. The median of average home-to-store distances ranged from 4 to 5 km across all cities throughout 2020. Shorter distances for grocery shopping were shown consistently for shoppers living in lower income, densely populated and low car-commuting ADAs. A maximum of three unique supermarkets were visited on average each month. Decreases in the frequency and variability of grocery store visits were shown across all cities in April 2020 following the implementation of restrictions in response to COVID-19, and pre-pandemic levels of shopping were rarely achieved by the end of the year. Ultimately, these results provide much needed information regarding the characteristics of grocery shopping trips in a high-income country, as well as how food shopping was impacted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The results reveal that relationships between connectivity and poverty have opposite signs in the two countries. For example, whereas intersection density and betweenness centrality positively influence the spatial agglomeration of low-income households in the US, the reverse pattern of association is observable in Mexico. Furthermore, differences in street layouts between low-income and high-income neighborhoods are more pronounced among Mexican cities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Results show that small towns are still the main service destinations providing various types of daily public services to hinterland villagers. It plays an important role in basic services such as agricultural production, daily supply of goods and primary medical services. As the level of goods or services rises, the public service capacity of small towns decreases, particularly in terms of inadequate higher-level medical services. Enhancing village-town bus services, shopping options, employment opportunities and the quality of healthcare services tend to strengthen the role of small towns in serving their villagers. More attention should be given to specialized services for low-income and disadvantaged groups with limited travel capacity. © 2023 Beijing University of Technology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In Chinese megacity centers, substandard housing is being removed. The inhabitants are relocated to peripheral large-scale residential areas, and we call them “relocatees”. After the relocation, their housing quality is improved but travel quality may worsen. Little attention has been paid to the change in travel equity over time for shopping-related trips of relocatees and non-relocatees in these areas in rapidly developing countries, especially for the change before and after the major built environment development, such as a shopping plaza’s opening. To fill this research gap, we conducted two surveys before and after Wanda Shopping Plaza’s opening. We used statistical analysis, estimated discrete choice models focusing on mode choice, and calculated consumer surplus as a measurement of travel equity. Results show a relocatee has a lower travel quality for shopping-related trips. Travel equity between relocatees and non-relocatees for shopping-related trips becomes worse after Wanda’s opening. Differences in consumer surplus between relocatees and non-relocatees provide a reference for the travel subsidy policy. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The hosting of mega sporting events will cause an ample increase in travel demand, causing an imbalance between supply and demand, so effective mobility management is essential. Mobility as a Service (MaaS) embodies a novel sustainable mobility paradigm and breathes fresh blood into mobility management. This work aims to reveal the potential acceptance of MaaS in the spectating context as well as the factors influencing the subscription of MaaS bundles, and to discuss the application of MaaS for mobility management at mega events. In the setting of the Hangzhou 2022 Asian Games, an online stated preference survey was conducted in mainland China regarding the entire travel process during the spectating period. Two mixed logit models were employed to analyze the choices of MaaS bundles in Airport/High-Speed Rail Station pick-up and drop-off (APD) scenario and Hotel-Venue (HV) scenario, respectively. Estimation results indicate that about 80% of the respondents are willing to subscribe to MaaS bundles and MaaS is capable of being used for mobility management. Household structure and income, as well as modality styles in daily and tourism, have significant impacts on the subscription intention of MaaS bundles. The results also show that respondents are sensitive to the subscription fees of MaaS bundles. Behavioral inertia is clearly demonstrated in the choice of APD MaaS bundles and obvious preference heterogeneity exists among respondents concerning the travel modes included in HV MaaS bundles. The findings from this study provide valuable information and strategies for transportation planners, event organizers, and those involved in the tourism sector. These insights can facilitate the implementation of personalized and sustainable smart mobility services during events or in tourism, enhancing the overall mobility experience. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is the area with the densest high-speed railway (HSR) network in China, and it leads the high-quality economic development (HQED) in the country. HSR plays an important role in regional development. However, research on the impact of the HSR on HQED is notably limited. Theoretically, this study develops an analytical framework for the mechanism of the HSR’s influence on HQED. Empirically, it calculates the HQED index and then investigates the impact of the HSR on HQED and the regional discrepancies across cities in the YRD, based on data from 2011 to 2019 using the difference-in-differences model. The results show: (1) The mechanism lies in that the HSR improves urban accessibility, accelerates the flow of the production factors, and enhances the allocation efficiency of the input factors. (2) The distribution of the HQED level presents an obvious circular pattern, with Shanghai and Suzhou at the centre, showing the prominent principle of distance decay. (3) Both the regression model and the robustness tests show that the HSR significantly promotes HQED in the YRD. Additionally, the economic development, foreign capital spent, financial level, industry advancement, and living standard are conducive to HQED. (4) The results of the heterogeneity test reveal that the HSR has an obviously varied impact on HQED in cities depending on their size and location. The HSR has a significant promotional effect on HQED in cities with a large population and those far away from a provincial city. © 2023 by the authors.},

Urban sprawl, as a specific manifestation of suburban morphology, belongs to the urban phenomena that is very often studied but still remains ambivalent. The ambivalence of the assessment results from the problems of weighing costs and benefits generated by sprawl. At the same time, there is a gap in international research on the costs and benefits of urban sprawl for households. Therefore, the aim of this article is to analyze and evaluate the household budgets in Poland in terms of potential costs and benefits of living in an urban sprawl area. The research hypothesis that households causing urban sprawl achieve net budgetary benefits was also adopted. In order to achieve the aim and verify the hypothesis, the data on the budgets of Polish households purchased from the Polish Central Statistical Office was used, and a questionnaire survey was carried out to determine the conclusions. The research hypothesis was not confirmed. The analysis and evaluation of many income and expenditure items of household budgets indicate that net costs in a significant group of budget items is high, while net benefits are relatively low. Households relocating to the sprawl zone, striving to meet their own needs, do not fully take into account all operating expenditures and ultimately incur net costs. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: The digital direct-to-consumer (D2C) approach has seen widespread adoption across many industries, but its application to regional food products has been slower. This study aims to identify and rank the most significant challenges to the widespread use of digital D2C for regional food products. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-criteria decision-making method called a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was used to determine the order in which these obstacles were evaluated. Thirty-five barriers were identified and categorized into six categories named technological, operational, sociocultural, financial, market and institutional and regulatory barriers. Findings: Market barriers ranked as the top barrier, and the technological barrier ranked the least significant amongst the main barrier categories for the adoption of digital D2C model for the regional food products. Lack of consumer awareness ranked number one globally, and lack of government subsidies ranked the least amongst the thirty-five identified barriers. Operational barriers came out to be second most significant barrier followed by institutional and regulatory barrier, sociocultural barrier, financial barrier and technological barrier. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this research were derived through a numerical examination of data gathered from the Indian setting. It follows that the technological, sociocultural, financial, market, operational and institutional constraints, among others, outlined here are all unique to India. Because of the unique nature of the Indian setting, the results of this study can only be used there and not elsewhere. It is possible that future research will broaden the aims of this one and refine its methodology. Digital D2C adoption for regional food products may be prioritized and ranked using quantitative and qualitative data sources like ANP and TOPSIS. It is possible that similar studies may be conducted in nations which have a different set of operational, technological, sociocultural market and financial and regulatory barriers. Conceptual framework can be formed by integrating TAM and TPB to understand the buying behavior of regional food products via digital D2C. Originality/value: This research is the first to identify challenges to the widespread use of the digital D2C model for regional food products. Policymakers and other interested parties can use this information to better understand the difficulties of expanding the distribution of regional food products beyond their immediate regions. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: How can the situation of shoppers staying at home and being unable to experience malls prepare retailers for the new marketplace? The COVID-19 lockdown provides a unique opportunity to examine the value of mall experiences to shoppers. This study aims to suggest a new mall experiences loss (MEXLOSS) model for assessing the importance of mall experiences as the foundation of any future strategy for attracting shoppers back to the mall. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 498 British shoppers completed an online survey during the May 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Findings: When the exchanges of resources manifested in mall experiences are absent, the perceived difficulty of substituting an experience increases shoppers’ longing for the experience, which in turn increases both willingness to pay and mall loyalty but decreases well-being. Using a conceptualization of four types of mall experiences, i.e. functional, seductive, recreational and social, the functional and recreational experiences are shown to be the most valuable. Practical implications: In the new more careful service marketplace, shoppers’ preferences are increasingly oriented toward health, safety, sustainability, collaboration and digitalization. To improve their resilience and attractiveness, malls need to adjust their layout, retail mix, digitalization, activities and connectivity according to these trends and to the characteristics of each mall experience. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to place a financial value on mall experiences and to use the absence of those experiences to assess their general and relative importance. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the superiority of online shopping and the decreasing attractiveness of malls. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The authors explore the effects of who is telling the underdog story and thus draw attention to the nature of the brand source by differentiating between family and non-family firms. The authors expect that who is telling the underdog story impacts consumers’ attitude toward the brand in terms of brand authenticity and trustworthiness perceptions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an online experiment with a 2 × 2 between-subject design and an overall sample size of 314 respondents. Findings: Most importantly, the authors find that the family-firm nature of the brand storyteller significantly impacts the underdog effect. The positive effects of underdog biographies on brand attitude in terms of authenticity and trustworthiness loom significantly larger for family firms compared with non-family firms. Practical implications: The authors find that the underdog effect is significantly stronger for family firms that tell the underdog story. Managers of family firms with underdog roots should take advantage of this finding by integrating underdog stories into their marketing concepts. The findings of this study show that the communication of a company’s roots can serve as a valuable tool to build and maintain a positive brand image and help to increase purchase intentions, which is particularly true for firms capitalizing on their family nature when telling the underdog story. Originality/value: The authors combine research on brand stories using the underdog effect with research on the consumer’s perception of family firms, further exploring the role of the brand storyteller in underdog narratives, resulting in important theoretical as well as practical implications. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The study aimed to determine customers’ perceptions of the ethics of social commerce platforms by investigating the role of the impact of information quality, information credibility, website quality, innovativeness, altruism, sense of belongingness, self-enhancement, social support, and valuation of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) on the perception of ethics of social commerce platforms. In addition, the strength of the relationship between these factors and the perception of ethics of social commerce platforms was determined by the mediating role of the perceived risk of ethical violations. To this end, this study complements academic literature by integrating structural equation modeling (SEM) and multi criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques. In order to complete the strategic decisive solution, this study uses a survey to collect data from customers of rural communities in Malaysia and Turkey. The results demonstrate that perceived risk of ethical violations has a partial mediating role in the relationship between dependent variables and the perception of ethics of social commerce platforms for Malaysia and Turkey. Benchmarking and ranking customers from best to worst based on the perception of ethics of social commerce would identify customers with a high perception of the ethics of social commerce platforms and motivate them as opinion leaders of such platforms. Contrarily, social commerce platforms can treat worst-ranked customers with caution and strive to turn a negative perception into positive ethics. Besides, the cross-cluster study at the level of Asia and Europe would contribute to the literature to identify insights into the differences and similarities between the Asian and European contexts based on multiple and diverse cultures regarding social commerce ethics of rural communities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The studies analyzing the relationships between e-shopping and transport mostly ignore the effects in active mobility. This paper complements current research by studying how e-shopping affects individual walking time willingness to reach daily and non-daily retail opportunities, taking the city of Zaragoza, Spain as a case study. First, a questionnaire is administered, followed by a generalised ordered logit regression model analysis. Then, a gravity-based model is used to compare present walking accessibility levels to retail with an exploratory 2030 scenario based on the regression results. The results indicate a positive association between the frequency of e-shopping and the individual time willingness to reach daily and non-daily retail on foot. They also show that high-educated people tend to have lower time-willingness to reach both types of retail. For non-daily retail, women shopping online are more likely to spend more time on walking, while having children under 12 years old and having a car are negatively associated with walking time-willingness. The exploratory 2030 scenario shows a relevant increase of walking accessibility to daily and non-daily retail. The paper closes with a discussion on how the obtained findings can provide guidelines to improve policies that promote walking and active lifestyles. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Travelers’ day-to-day mobility depends on their perceptions, experiences, and personal characteristics. Many accessibility measures overlook perceptual factors and mainly consider space–time limitations of mobility, overestimating travelers’ potential mobility. We introduce a novel inclusive accessibility concept that advances time-geographic accessibility measures in light of travel behavior theories. We conceptualize inclusive accessibility as a subset of the classic space–time prism (STP) that incorporates hard constraints (e.g., limited infrastructure and services and time) and soft constraints (e.g., perceptions of safety and comfort toward the built environment and infrastructure and travel time preferences). We collected survey data on individual-level mobility perceptions and applied machine learning algorithms to predict personalized soft constraints for walking. Considering public transit and walking, we model and compare three network-based STPs: classic STP with hard constraints, inclusive STP with soft spatial constraints, and inclusive STP with soft spatial and temporal constraints. Our method demonstrates heterogeneities in individuals’ mobility perceptions. We illustrate that the individual’s level of accessibility shrinks substantially as we approach more conservative measures that include travel perceptions. Our method highlights the differences between travelers’ physically and psychologically accessible space depending on their travel choices and exposure. © 2023 The Author(s).

Specifically, we combine three analytical methods – partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), necessary condition analysis (NCA), and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) – to create an expanded analytical process that enables informed decision-making. PLS-SEM identifies significant correlations between the predictor and outcome variables, NCA identifies critical bottlenecks required for a specific outcome, and fsQCA identifies configurations of conditions sufficient for producing a specific outcome. By applying this expanded analytical process to subjectively reported data on service quality and perceived accessibility, collected from five Nordic cities, we gain new insights into attracting an aging population to public transport.

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, data was collected from banking consumers in India. The final sample included 505 responses. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. Findings: The findings suggest that consumer perceptions of CSR are positively related to consumer identification with the company and CCB. Also, the relationship between consumer perception of CSR and CCB is mediated through consumer–company identification. This suggests that CSR activities are positively related with the consumer identification with their company, which encourages CCB. Originality/value: This study contributes empirically and theoretically to expand the limited knowledge about the cognitive link between CSR and consumer behaviour. This study provides new insights about the proposed relationships related to the effects of consumer perception of CSR on CCB. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study performs a transport accessibility analysis both at national and first/last-leg levels, by comparing the accessibility of the Campania SEZ areas, the other SEZ areas in Italy and all the other Italian local labour systems. The study focuses on the Campania region, as it represents the first Italian pilot project of spatial planning through the establishment of SEZs. The Campania region exhibits, on average, good transport accessibility both at a national level (considering the multi-modal freight Italian transport network) and at a first/last-leg level (considering relevant nodes of the network, such as tollbooths, freight stations, ports, interports and airports). Also, the impact of SEZ implementation on land use planning has been discussed, to provide a useful tool for stakeholders that are interested in revitalizing the area, at different levels: i) land use policymakers, to plan interventions/planning concerning infrastructures and spatial planning; ii) national policymakers, to establish SEZs in other geographical areas; iii) investors, to assess the convenience of investments in this geographical area. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This study contributes to this growing field of research by addressing crowdsourcing integration into last mile delivery. To consider crowdsourced delivery options, an individual crowdsourced fleet is characterized in terms of its delivery pricing. A mathematical model is proposed to determine the potential set of locations for terminals for delivery-dedicated and individual crowdsourced fleets, with the objective of minimizing the total last mile delivery cost when demand and delivery pricing change depending on the floating population of a given city. Through numerical experiments with the annual floating population data in Ulsan Metropolitan City in the Republic of Korea, we identify the optimal sets of terminals for the integrated last mile delivery platform consisting of delivery-dedicated and individual crowdsourced fleets. Results show that the proposed model significantly reduces total cost by employing crowd workers in highly populated areas rather than those merely positioned close to the final delivery destinations. Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis is conducted regarding three cost parameters that are likely to impact the effectiveness and efficiency of the last mile delivery process. We further analyze the cost and carbon emissions associated with integrating crowdsourcing into the last mile delivery platform as well as the strategic distribution of incentive pay to encourage the shift to electric vehicles for last mile deliveries. Lastly, we investigate the effects of different traffic conditions on the optimal solutions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Objectives Changes in public sector service spending may influence food consumption. We make use of changing local authority (LA) expenditure in England to assess impacts on food purchasing. We examine total LA service spending and explore two potential pathways: highways and transport spending which may affect access to food; and housing service expenditure which may affect household resources available to purchase foods. Design Longitudinal panel survey at the LA level (2008-2015) using fixed effects linear regression. Setting 324 LAs in England. Main exposure Expenditure per capita on total LA services, highways and transport services, and housing services. Main outcome measures LA area estimates of purchasing of fresh fruits and vegetables, high in fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) foods, and takeaways at home, expressed as a percentage of total food and drink expenditure. Results Total LA service spending decreased by 17% on average between 2008 and 2015. A 10% decrease in total LA spending was associated with a 0.071 percentage point decrease in HFSS (95% CI-0.093 to-0.050) and a 0.015 percentage point increase in takeaways (95% CI 0.006 to 0.024). A 10% decrease in highways and transport expenditure was associated with a 0.006 percentage point decrease in fruit and vegetable purchasing (95% CI-0.009 to-0.002) and a 0.006 percentage point increase in takeaway purchasing (95% CI 0.001 to 0.010). These associations were seen in urban areas only when analyses were stratified by rural/urban area status. A 0.006 percentage point decrease in HFSS purchasing was also seen with a 10% decrease in housing expenditure (95% CI-0.010 to-0.002). Conclusion Changes in LA spending may have impacts on food purchasing which are evident at the area level. This suggests that in addition to more prominent impacts such as foodbank use, austerity measures may have mixed impacts on food purchasing behaviours among the wider population. Individual-level research is needed to further elucidate these relationships.  © },

The proposed T-VD models explicitly consider the complexities of a public transport network, including transfers between different transport modes, dynamic transit schedules, changing network topologies, etc. To efficiently construct T-VDs, geo-computational algorithms are developed by modifying and integrating classical shortest-path algorithms in road networks and transit shortest-path algorithms in public transport networks. Case study results show significant differences between T-VDs and N-VDs, highlighting the need for using T-VDs in urban areas with well-developed public transport systems.

	abstract = {Purpose: Despite luxury's increasing globalization and broadening scope via digitalization and new markets, the intellectual structure of the overall research corpus remains tenuous. This work therefore aims to provide an overview of published work on international luxury marketing and to contribute to a better understanding of the research area. Design/methodology/approach: Using a systematic approach, 1151 items (papers) were retrieved and 181 selected from the international luxury marketing field published before 2019. These items were analyzed by using various bibliometric techniques to identify the most productive countries, journals, influential authors, papers and research clusters. Findings: Although most of the outputs originate from business, management and marketing journals, other disciplines also research this topic. The analysis reveals an emerging field, with 85% of the published papers appearing between 2010 and 2018, which are primarily the output of US- and UK-based authors and none of whom dominates the field. The three identified keyword clusters are (1) consumers and consumption (2) tools and (3) core themes. Practical implications: This article contributes to our understanding of the evolution, current status and research trends of published research on international luxury marketing by presenting a mapping analysis and proposing future research directions. Originality/value: This is the first bibliometric mapping analysis of research on the topic from its conception to 2019. It contributes insights from different research disciplines, adds to the categorization of the international luxury marketing literature and provides promising future research directions in terms of research areas and strategies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In the scientific community, the concept of services of general interest is relatively new, even though its components have been examined in various ways for several decades. The term "service of general interest" is a political and normative expression introduced by the European Union. While it is challenging to provide a precise definition, services of general interest are generally understood as service activities that public administration bodies in a specific country or region designate as activities contributing to the public welfare. In geographical research, individual elements of this concept are often analysed, such as the provision of infrastructure and services in settlements, the organization of central places, or the accessibility of services in a specific area. This paper aims to organize fundamental knowledge about services of general interest, as found in scientific and professional literature; with the intention of analysing definitions and classifications of these services, exploring the scientific interest in distinct service categories, examining the spatial organization of services, and investigating their accessibility and adaptation in response to modern social, economic, and technological changes. © 2023, Croatian Geographical Society.

	abstract = {The article considers the quality of neighborhood services available to local residents as a dimension of perceived spatial segregation. The concept of “neighborhoodness” of services targets evaluation of local amenities as demanded by neighbors and positively assessed as satisfying their daily needs. The study addresses the gap in neighborhood services studies, mostly focused on service accessibility and variety and their impact on housing and land value, but paying little attention to both perceived quality and available accessibility of services at the neighborhood level. We argue that two types of neighborhood services should be distinguished: local services aimed at residents and services physically localized in the neighborhood but aimed at external user groups. The research methodology is based on consideration of the subjective and objective dimensions of the neighborhood services by comparing data on objective availability of services and subjective data on perceived accessibility of services taken from neighbors’ discussions. Two online neighborhood communities localized in a historical and in a new housing areas of Saint Petersburg, Russia, are considered, each covering more than 9,000 participants regularly conversing about their neighborhoods. The analysis of the objective availability of services covers typology and user quality metrics of venues within the selected pedestrian boundaries presented in Google Maps. The analysis of the perception of services is based on a semiautomated analysis of semantic fields of “service” concepts such as restaurant, café, store, qualitatively identified as intensively discussed in the communities. Eventually specific patterns of service-related neighborhood-level segregation in historical and new housing urban zones are identified and addressed with recommendations on service development © Laboratorium: журнал социальных исследований},

Whereas previous urban planning has addressed problems caused by urbanization and population growth, current urban planning must closely consider demographic changes such as an aging society. An aging population, characterized by an increased need for regular healthcare and a growing reliance on public transport, can pose a major challenge to equitable cities. Thus, it is necessary to scrutinize the medical and public transportation links in urban planning strategies to create a more equitable city in an aging society. This study analyzed primary care accessibility for older adults using public transportation in Seoul and considered whether it is socially and economically equitable. Primary care accessibility was derived using the modified 2SFCA model and the Seoul Public Transportation API and social equity was analyzed using the concentration index and concentration curve. The results showed that primary care accessibility of the elderly is related to public transportation mobility, medical facilities and the distribution of elderly populations, revealing both social and economic inequality. This analysis suggests the need for integrated urban planning for an equitable city in an aging society, with implications for efficient resource distribution. © 2022 by the authors.},

A three-pronged approach is employed, namely the quantile cross-spectral coherency approach, the time-varying parameter vector autoregressions (TVP-VAR), and the Causality in quantiles methodology. The quantile coherency results show that connectivity between new generation blockchains and conventional and Islamic markets varies. It was found that the connectedness of the network of variables rises in the medium run and reaches its peak in the long run as a result of the TVP-VAR approach. It is evident from the results that the application of sharia screening only impacts the relationship between the technology stock index and digital assets significantly, but does not affect the connectedness and causality between the two.

	abstract = {Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a tool that aids in achieving sustainable urban development. It promotes economic, environmental, and social sustainability by integrating land use and transportation planning. Many researchers have investigated mass rapid transit (MRT) station regions for TOD in developed cities. However, in a developing city such as Dhaka, measuring node-based TOD (TOD index) during MRT construction has been disregarded in planning future land use. Furthermore, no prior research on quantitative TOD measurement in Dhaka exists. As a result, we developed a framework for both quantitative and spatial node-based TOD measurement based on the four Ds (density, diversity, destination accessibility, and design) of the TOD concept. With 17 stations under construction, MRT 6 was selected as our study area. The TOD index was measured by nine indicators based on the four criteria (4Ds), spatially in the geographic information system (GIS). After calculating the indicators, the TOD index for each station’s 800m buffer was estimated using the spatial multi-criteria analysis (SMCA). A sensitivity analysis of four TOD scenarios was performed to check the model’s robustness. Additionally, a heatmap of the TOD index for MRT 6 was created for informed planning and policymaking. Furthermore, statistically significant hotspots (both Getis Org Gi* and Anselen Local Moran Statistics) and hotspot clusters were identified. Finally, we illustrate the station-based ranking based on the maximum TOD score. In addition, a detailed spider-web of nine indicators for 17 stations depicts sustainable TOD planning. However, regarding density and diversity, sustainable development and (re) development policies should be implemented not only for MRT 6 but for all Dhaka’s TOD regions. © 2023 Uddin et al.

	abstract = {We investigate how the development of supermarkets and public markets in a large, rapidly urbanizing African city can shape the equitability of the food system. Using remotely sensed retailer location and population datasets, we analyze the spatial–temporal development of supermarkets and public markets in Lusaka, Zambia from 2004 to 2020. As Lusaka's population grew by 116%, we found that supermarkets increased from 9 to 54 (500%) while public markets increased from 52 to 65 (25%). Using SaTScan spatial–temporal analysis, we identified seven significant areas of high supermarket development (p < 0.05) clustered from 2013 to 2020 in lower density, higher income residential areas. During this period ten new community public markets were established, suggesting a lack of direct involvement by the government to establish public markets at a pace similar to population growth. Supermarket development without concomitant development of public markets can negatively impact food system equitability in two ways: 1) supermarket development is spatially uneven, favoring more food secure residential areas, thus limiting food access; 2) supermarket development is outpacing the establishment of public markets, which have more favorable food purchasing conditions for low-income households. Improving food security in rapidly growing Southern African cities will require policies that promote retailer diversity and aim to improve urban food system resilience and equitability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This study collected responses from intercepted regular urban rail travelers at three metro stations with distinct built-form and land-use characteristics. Local conditions of access on foot, by bicycle, or on a bus were evaluated retrospectively on a five-point satisfaction scale and compared with an independent survey of the same access routes. Three-factor theory and dummy variable regression methods were used to identify the factor structure of environmental attributes under different access means. In the results, access and egress satisfaction were more important than metro trip satisfaction in overall trip satisfaction for walking and cycling modes. Access distance was not significant for walking and marginally negative for cycling satisfaction. For pedestrians, street connectivity, pathway directness, shade, greenery, and crossing safety were all significant (p < 0.05), explaining 51% of the variance in expressed satisfaction. For bicyclists, directness, distance, service, and parking facilities were significant in satisfaction, accounting for 62% of variance. In the bus access model, we found that bus stop location is very important, with passengers also very concerned about the walk experience to the bus stop. Satisfaction with access and egress environments is important in overall satisfaction with travel by public transport. © 2022 by the authors.},

This can be achieved by sharing the infrastructure of freight and public transportation systems. Additionally, failed deliveries represent a major challenge in e-commerce. Lockers can address this problem and promote sustainable urban freight transport. This paper identified a locker network in a public transportation infrastructure. The framework considered scenarios built under the 15-min city concept, and the analysis is based on a case study in Jaraguá do Sul (Brazil, a mid-sized Brazilian city, and its conurbated area. The networks were found by solving a p-median problem, which minimised the maximum distance between the lockers and the population. The findings showed that, in the best scenario with 16 lockers, the population could reach the lockers within a 10-min cycling ride. Additionally, the results showed that the public transportation network provides a locker network to integrate freight and public transportation. The locker network is accessible to public transportation and micromobility users. With this solution, residents play an active role in last-mile deliveries. In addition, lockers can work as mini hubs for crowdshipping services. In addition to reducing urban delivery trips, this solution can encourage public transportation usage, which contributes to more sustainable cities. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Using smart card travel data, we compare demand for bus services by passengers of age 65 or older prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify public transport-reliant users residing in more car-dependent environments—i.e., people who rely on public transport services to carry out essential activities, such as daily shopping and live in areas with low public transport accessibility. Viewing lockdowns as natural experiments, we use spatial analysis combined with multilevel logistic regressions to characterize the demographic and geographic context of those passengers who continued to use public transport services in these areas during lockdown periods, or quickly returned to public transport when restrictions were eased. We find that this particular type of public transport reliance is significantly associated with socio-demographic characteristics alongside urban residential conditions. Specifically, we identify suburban geographies of public transport reliance, which are at risk of being overlooked in approaches that view public transport dependence mainly as an outcome of deprivation. Our research demonstrates once again that inclusive, healthy and sustainable mobility can only be achieved if all areas of metropolitan regions are well and reliably served by public transport.

Our empirical strategy explores China's high-speed rail (HSR) rollouts as a plausibly exogenous shock on transportation improvements. An event study shows that the parallel trends assumption is violated, which suggests the need to control for city-specific trends. The difference-in-differences framework then reveals that HSR has some positive but statistically insignificant effects on both air and water pollution discharge intensities. Nevertheless, we observe several salient heterogeneity effects. HSR reduces both types of pollution from heavily polluting industries, and also alleviates air pollution in central cities, the central areas of a city, and cities with a larger proportion of secondary industry. We interpret these heterogeneity effects according to the industrial and spatial restructuring of economies due to HSR. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: Africa has been identified as an area where higher mortality happens due to un-accessibility to health care, drugs and other health facilities. Nigeria, as one of the African countries, is not excluded from such difficulties. This study aims to examine the determinants of efficient last-mile delivery at selected health facilities and the Kaduna State Health Supplies Management Agency (KADSHMA). Design/methodology/approach: The study sourced data from KADSHMA and the health facilities’ staff, with a total of 261 observations used. Likewise, the respondents were picked from warehouses of each health facility and KADSHMA. The data was analysed using the partial least square structural equation modelling analysis to estimate the relationship among the variables of the study. Findings: The study’s findings revealed that all five variables of the study (i.e. determinants) were significantly affecting the efficient last-mile delivery. Four constructs (delivery cost [DC], delivery time [DT], mode of delivery [MD] and facilities technology [FT]) have shown a positive and significant association with efficient last-mile delivery, whereas one variable (product mix [PM]) indicated a negative and significant association with efficient last-mile delivery. The study concludes that DC, DT, MD, FT and PM played significant roles in efficient last-mile delivery. Research limitations/implications: The study provides that specific means of transportation should always be on standby to transport health supplies. Time schedules should always be prepared and adhered to when transporting health supplies to the facilities, and each facility should network with robust technology to ease communication in terms of order and order planning. Additionally, facilities should try as much as possible to reduce the varieties of products when ordering health supplies, as it will increase the efficiency of the delivery. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first of its kind that considered these five variables (DC, DT, MD, FT and PM) with impact on the last-mile delivery in one model, especially in the Nigerian case. This is a great contribution to knowledge, more importantly, to the last-mile delivery of the health sector. The result confirmed the importance of these determinants (DC, DT, FT and PM) of last-mile delivery efficiency in saving lives. © 2022, Nuraddeen Usman Miko and Usman Abbas.},

	abstract = {Making the city center physically accessible is crucial to ensure that everyone has equitable access to the city center for various reasons. There should be no discriminatory practices restricting anyone from participating in society. Numerous studies, however, reveal that persons with disabilities (PWD) have fewer opportunities to engage in built environment activities than non-disabled individuals owing to the inaccessible design of buildings, public spaces and transportation services. Despite the fact that PWD's inclusion is tied to physical space, little effort has been made to explore PWD's lived experience in reaching the city center by using different transportation options. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate a go-along interview as one of the key data collection methods for examining barriers faced by PWD in using various transportation modes in Klang Valley. This qualitative study involves twenty go-along interviews with mobility-impaired travelers to learn about their actual experiences traveling using land transportation from around Klang Valley to Kuala Lumpur city center. Mobility-impaired travelers, notably wheelchair users, still need help to reach their destination with the current transportation services. In general, the use of transportation in Klang Valley has several issues, such as the lack of transportation-related facilities and lack of safety concerns from the service providers. The go-along journeys also demonstrated that, besides physical barriers, PWD encounters attitudinal and psycho-emotional barriers, which may lead to exclusion.  © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {The transformation towards a sustainable power system calls for new ways of operating the network. In that regard, electric vehicles (EVs) with their charging infrastructure qualify as a flexible resource. This paper interconnects ancillary services and EV flexibility to help system operators (SOs) and flexibility providers understand the role and localize EV-chargers in the power system. First, the focus is on SOs. The manuscript reviews ancillary services based on power system operational challenges. The ancillary services are differentiated between 8 frequency and 32 flexibility services. These are then subdivided depending on the management control: the first group includes inertia, primary, and secondary/tertiary frequency control, while the second includes congestion management, voltage regulation, power quality, grid stability, and emission management. Of all the different services, the ones that can be provided by EV-charger are highlighted and classified into 12 geo-electrical charging clusters. Second, the focus is moved to the flexibility providers. Independently from location, to provide ancillary services with EVs, multiple actors are recognized: the end-user, the charging site operator (CSO), the charging point operator (CPO), the aggregator, the energy community, the distribution system operator (DSO), and the transmission system operator (TSO). The collaboration between the actors is today carried out by making alliances, to help exchange knowledge and gain confidence in ancillary services provision. In conclusion, the literature review presents the characteristics of 27 slow (up to 50 kW) smart chargers, the common flexibility features being scheduling (100%), modulation (89%), and phase switching (10%). © 2022 The Author(s)},

But because of the dissatisfaction regarding the bus service, the number of passengers in the buses are reducing. Therefore, quality of the city bus service is estimated based on users’ perception of present service quality and perception of expected service quality. A questionnaire survey was carried out to collect the users’ perception data. Data was analysed using factor analysis, path analysis and regression analysis to estimate the factor effecting users’ perception. It is found that a gap in users’ perception of present and expected service quality leads to dissatisfaction. Six performance indicators namely safety, vehicle condition & hygiene, comfort, reliability & convenience, information availability and reasonable travel expenses are found to effect user's perception of service quality. It is found that the users are having high dissatisfaction levels in terms of safety, comfort, vehicle condition & hygiene and reliability & convenience and information availability of the bus service. The categorical analysis of the data show that with increasing income and age, the users are more concerned with the safety, comfort and vehicle condition & hygiene than the travel expense. Female users are found to be more concerned with the safety and vehicle condition & hygiene of the service than the male users. Very few studies emphasised on perception of expected service quality along with the perception of present service quality. But in this study both the expectation and perception of the users are considered. Moreover, the categorical analysis of the data will be helpful in understanding priorities of different factors so that improvement can be done based on the priorities of the users. © 2022 World Conference on Transport Research Society},

After controlling for a range of factors, we find that faster broadband speeds brought by NGA technologies have a positive effect on the rate of business growth. We find that in England between 2011 and 2015, on average a one percentage increase in download speeds is associated with a 0.0574 percentage point increase in the annual growth rate of business establishments. The primary hypothesised mechanism behind the estimated relationship is the enabling effect that faster broadband speeds have on innovative business models based on new digital technologies and services. Entrepreneurs either sought appropriate locations that offer high quality broadband infrastructure (contributing to new business establishment growth), or potentially enjoyed a competitive advantage (resulting in a higher survival rate). The findings of this study suggest that aspiring to reach universal high–capacity broadband connectivity is economically desirable, especially as the costs of delivering broadband services decline. © 2023},

However, in large cities in developing countries where the low-income and high-income groups are clearly divided, differences in consumer behavior between income groups may affect service distribution. The literature shows that most consumers may use pick-up points when available. However, the service implementation is facing huge inertia. A survey was carried out with 396 consumers in São Paulo, and a conceptual framework was proposed to expand the Diffusion of Innovation Theory to reveal these behaviors. Data were accessed using advanced structural equation modeling techniques (Multigroup and IPMA) to conduct a case study. The findings suggest that ‘Trialability’, ‘Compatibility’, and ‘Relative advantage’ constructs most affect consumer behavior. Location security and accessibility are matters of great concern. The higher preference to use the pick-up point system comes from low-income consumers (social classes D and E); almost 96% of them reported being affected by delivery issues. They also prefer personal attendance and supermarkets as safe and accessible locations. Higher social classes (A and B) still prefer home delivery. This research will help retailers to understand how to operate in a given market to provide an effective, fair, and sustainable service, promoting its diffusion. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Debt financing is related to borrowing funds from enterprises and investors through bonds, banks, or financial institutions. Interest in debt financing has been rapidly growing in recent years and is now considered one of the most common ways an enterprise can increase its capital to run its business. However, the use of a large amount of debt is associated with the management of corporate indebtedness, requiring the tracking of the entire financial performance of the company. The chief objective of this study was to determine and assess the indebtedness level of enterprises operating in the Slovak Republic using 12 crucial debt ratios and then to clarify whether there are statistically relevant dissimilarities in corporate debt as a result of the firm size and its legal form, representing relevant company-specific features having an impact on corporate indebtedness. Subsequently, a more elaborate analysis addressing statistically relevant dissimilarities between separate indebtedness ratios in relation to the size of the company and its legal form was carried out by deploying the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test. We leveraged the Bonferroni correction to specify where stochastic ascendancy occurs. The Kruskal–Wallis test result revealed statistically significant dissimilarities in the values of debt ratios as a result of the firm size and the legal form of the company, which confirmed previous results indicating the most relevant determinants shaping corporate debt. Recognizing the repercussions of firm size and legal form on the corporate debt policy plays an important role, as these company-specific features may be perceived as proxies for the default likelihood or for the volatility of corporate assets, making the regulatory process of creditors and stakeholders straightforward. The findings confirmed the theories of numerous researchers who claimed that firm size and legal form are critical aspects of corporate debt. © 2023 by the authors.},

The opportunity structure for bargaining, consisting of internal and external factors encouraging or facilitating union engagement with work–family measures, has developed unevenly in the British case, resulting in only a small number of agreements overall. Collectively agreed provision offers significant benefits mainly for maternity leave and pay. The analysis finds evidence of a dynamic of bargaining whereby those organisations with enhanced maternity pay continued to extend provision and to introduce new enhancements for fathers through paternity leave, but also identifies the limits of this dynamic due to complexity of policy design. The article argues that trade unions can coordinate bargaining strategy even in the absence of formal mechanisms for doing so, but that local strategy depends on the external opportunity structure at all levels. © Australian Labour and Employment Relations Association (ALERA) 2021 SAGE Publications Ltd, Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, Singapore and Washington DC.},

	abstract = {We analyze the general equilibrium effects of an asymmetric decrease in transport costs, combining a large-scale spatial dynamic general equilibrium model for 267 European NUTS-2 regions with a detailed transport model at the level of individual road segments. As a case study, we consider the impact of the road infrastructure investments in Central and Eastern Europe of the European Cohesion Policy. Our analysis suggests that the decrease in transportation costs benefits the targeted regions via substantial increases in gross domestic product (GDP) and welfare compared to the baseline, and a small increase in population. The geographic information embedded in the transport model leads to relatively large predicted benefits in peripheral countries such as Greece and Finland, which hardly receive funds, but whose trade links cross Central and Eastern Europe, generating profit from the investments there. The richer, Western European nontargeted regions also enjoy a higher GDP after the investment in the East, but these effects are smaller. Thus, the policy reduces interregional disparities. There are rippled patterns in the predicted policy spillovers. In nontargeted countries, regions trading more intensely with regions where the investment is taking place on average benefit more compared to other regions within the same country, but also compared to neighboring regions across an international border. We uncover that regions importing goods from Central and Eastern Europe enjoy the largest spillovers. These regions become more competitive and expand exports, to the detriment of other regions in the same country. © 2023 The Authors. Journal of Regional Science published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

In the last two decades, as part of the international economic crisis, Greece has been at the center of changes that have resulted in the closure of thousands of businesses. This significantly affected Greek cities by changing their economic profile and robustness via the spatial distribution of their economic activities. Economic geography, as a sector that examines the geographical distribution of economic activities, is an im-portant methodological base for analysing business locations and urban spatial processes. This paper aims to analyse, through a combination of economic geography theories and spatial analysis methods, the spatial patterns of economic activities and to identify urban areas that are resilient in difficult times of crisis. Thus cities that have the ability, via the proposed analysis/methodological framework, to control and evaluate their economic profile and prospects, can be transformed into smart cities by adopting ad hoc urban renaissance and resilient policies. © 2022 by the authors.

This scoping review aims to synthesise the current state of knowledge and gaps surrounding transportation equity in EV charging research. Following PRISMA-Scr protocols, a literature search is conducted to locate articles that explicitly or implicitly discuss EV charging equity. Our review finds that research on charging equity is nascent and lacking in clear normative evaluations of equity compared to the wider body of transportation equity literature. Only slightly more than one-in-four of an identified 37 articles discuss equity and justice explicitly. Equity perspectives in charging research are dominated by North American and European perspectives, with limited perspectives from the rest of the world. Charging incentivisation schemes and planning efforts may not be equity focused and may favour wealthier individuals, and there are differences in the charging needs and desires of high adoption groups compared to low adoption groups. These findings, however, often come from geographically and philosophically limited contexts and there are gaps in the literature for new methodological and topical contributions to this area. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Smart-working practices do not always run smoothly despite the necessary infrastructure being in place. Taking the quality-value-loyalty chain and information system continuance model as the basis, this study aims to identify how “smart-work support service” leads to employees’ continuance intention toward smart-work. In this study, the smart-work support service refers to the infrastructure making smart-work possible and services needed to support smart-work. Design/methodology/approach: Using data collected from a survey of 406 employees working in Korea, this study verifies the components of smart-work support service quality and dimensions of perceived value through partial least squares analysis and then tests the proposed conceptual model using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results verified that the quality of smart-work support service consists of eight attributes while dividing the perceived value of smart-work into three dimensions and further revealed that the service quality influences the intention to continue smart-working by way of perceived value and satisfaction. Originality/value: This study sought to explore the relationship among service quality, perceived value and satisfaction by clearly conceptualizing and measuring them in the context of smart-work, thereby ultimately understanding the impact they have on the intention to continue smart-work. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In today’s world, accessibility is considered a key and complementary criterion while increasing the stability of a transportation system, in addition to the importance of proper density and spatial distribution of people and activities and land use development, which is known as urban policy and services and it is also considered a precondition for economic development. Although accessibility has been extensively explored in recent decades, transportation planners still face many challenges. Therefore, it is important to know the factors and criteria affecting access in each time period. These criteria can include mobility, quality and cost-effectiveness of transportation, the connection of transportation systems, mobility alternatives, land use patterns and socio-economic characteristics that can affect the concept of access differently; on the other hand, a more comprehensive study of accessibility can increase the range of potential solutions to transportation problems. The present study provides a general but comprehensive overview of the various dimensions and indicators of access in the form of a literature review. The results show that there is a lot of interaction with the goals of integration and sustainability, which can be achieved under the key elements. The first element is the selection of techniques that can be presented in the light of evaluation along with specific and clear objectives that can be achieved in practice and reflect their ease. The second element is the use of techniques to provide sufficient indicators according to regional patterns, taking into account all objectives, of course, as general performance indicators that are not limited to social justice. Perhaps one of the effective options is the use of visualization tools. It means using maps that provide solutions. It provides a link between transportation gaps and benefits where access-based criteria can potentially influence transportation decisions. Also, the findings show that to strengthen the accessibility goal, accessibility indicators should be clearly considered, and a distinction should be made between this concept and mobility in transportation planning. © 2022 WIT Press.},

	abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in an unprecedented overnight explosion in telecommuting. It has highlighted a new dependence on digital infrastructures and raised new questions regarding the resilience of internet connectivity as an alternative to travel. Pre-pandemic, we considered how telecommuting could offer an opportunity for resilience when travel was disrupted by weather extremes. We analysed five years’ of recorded broadband speed variation across England and Wales in order to quantify the changing demand for internet access during the working day under adverse weather conditions. Slower broadband speeds, also known as contention, are an indication of increased demand. Thus, during the working day, contention is an indication that external factors like weather can influence the choice to telecommute instead of travel. A multilevel regression model is estimated to investigate the relationship between contention during the working day and weather, whilst controlling for background spatial and demographic differences in internet services. Emergent patterns suggest that even before the pandemic, online connectivity was in greater demand when travel was disrupted or at risk of disruption. Our research provides insights into the roles that both the supply of and the demand for transport and digital technologies might play in increasing resilience and maintaining productivity during severe weather and other disruptions as experience of both types of working has become so widespread. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Preventing high concentrations of fine particulate (PM2.5) to realize the goal of sustainable development is becoming a challenge for rapidly urbanized cities. Increasing vehicle emission due to inefficient urban form is thought to be the main cause of traffic congestion and increased PM2.5 concentrations. Previous efforts attributing PM2.5 concentrations to urban forms are yet to reach consistent conclusions on practical environmental protection strategies. In this study, we considered urban compositions and their spatial configuration to propose a new measurement—urban configuration—and document the effects of urban configuration on PM2.5 concentrations. Using 330 Chinese cities as our sample, we found that the areas of two types of urban facilities, namely, residence and industry, are positively related to PM2.5 concentrations, and the area of public service facilities is negatively related to PM2.5 concentrations. Regarding the spatial configuration of different urban compositions, we documented that residence–industry accessibility is a key factor of PM2.5 concentrations and plays a more important role than the residence–commerce accessibility. We also compared the influence of two accessibility indices (distance- and gravity-based accessibilities) and further found that the effect of reducing the residence–industry distance is more remarkable than the effect of increasing residential or industrial area on reducing PM2.5 concentrations. Our results indicate that the key to reaching sustainable urban expansion is to synchronize urban constructions with spatial configuration optimization. For Chinese cities, a 7.52% increase in residence area requires at least 1% decrease in the average residence–industry distance to eliminate the incremental effects of newly constructed residential region on PM2.5 concentrations. This study casts new light on the relationship between urban configuration and PM2.5 concentration and provides decision makers practical and realistic approaches in realizing sustainable development goals. © 2022},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the emerging potential of mid-tier transit, articulating how a complex set of established and new factors could contribute both to better transit outcomes and the associated urban regeneration around station precincts. The analysis is based on two structured literature reviews, supported by insights from the authors’ original research. The first provides an overview of the established and new rationale for mid-tier technologies such as the established Light Rail Transit (LRT) and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) as well as the new Trackless Tram Systems (TTS). The established role for mid-tier transit is now being given extra reasons for it to be a major focus of urban infrastructure especially due to the need for net zero cities. The second review, is a detailed consideration of established and new factors that can potentially improve patronage on mid-tier transit. The established factors of urban precinct design like stop amenities and improved accessibility and density around stations, are combined with new smart technology systems like advanced intelligent transport systems and real-time transport information for travellers, as well as new transport technologies such as micro-mobility and Mobility on Demand. Also explored are new processes with funding and development models that properly leverage land value capture, public private partnerships, and other entrepreneurial development approaches that are still largely not mainstreamed. All were found to potentially work, especially if done together, to help cities move into greater mid-tier transit. © 2023 by author(s).

Goods managed to maintain a high level of mobility, thus guaranteeing the supply of cities and limiting the possible effects of shortages. Urban supply chains adapted well to rapidly changing consumption behaviors (one in three consumers who made online food purchases during the first lockdowns in Europe were new to this channel) and changes in supplies to industrial sectors. In the public eye (governments, media, the general public), logistics has become an essential activity and while it has always been strategic for cities, it has become much more visible. To report on these changes, this chapter presents a review of the already quite substantial scientific literature on COVID-19 and freight, develops the case study of Paris, France, and discusses policy issues and future directions related to urban logistics and COVID-19. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Highway access provides important advantages for firms and households, generating powerful incentives to develop new built areas through the conversion of vacant land. Based on the case study of the expansion of Highway 30 on Montréal's South Shore region between 2000 and 2019, this paper investigates how new highway infrastructure impacts the construction of new industrial and commercial buildings on individual parcels. Using a panel dataset, an event study model is developed to estimate the impact of the proximity to highway access ramps on the probability of construction. Results show that highway infrastructure increases the probability of construction of new industrial and commercial buildings, even if public authorities aim to limit such possibilities by legal constraints and laws. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Drawing on the literature of numerical cognition, associative learning, goal activation, and variety-seeking, the current research examines how numerical parity affects consumers' variety-seeking behavior. Across one Implicit Association Test (IAT) and four experiments, we demonstrate that consumers associate odd (vs. even) numbers with changeability (vs. stability) in their minds (Study 1). We further find that exposure to product and other marketing related information that is presented with odd (vs. even) numbers increases consumers' tendency to seek variety in subsequent purchase decisions, and that this effect consistently appears in the voluntary selection of a set of options (Study 2a), the preference for diversified products (Study 2b and 3), and the choice of diversified product bundles (Study 2c). We further demonstrate that desire for change underlines this effect, such that exposure to odd numbers (vs. even numbers) activates consumers' desire for change, which in turn elevates their subsequent variety-seeking behavior (Study 3). The findings of the current research not only contribute to the literature, but also provide marketers with effective ways to facilitate consumers' variety-seeking behavior, such as by strategically using odd numbers in their marketing efforts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Analysis of the accessibility impacts of logistics suburbanization is critical for logistics land-use planning practices. To understand these impacts, this paper conceptualizes logistics service accessibility from two perspectives in terms of urban logistics infrastructure networks (ULINs) and logistics land use stakeholders in the network, and proposes a novel quantitative approach for their measurement. We measure the service accessibility of ULINs via solving a bi-objective binary integer program which considers the facility spatial coverage and vehicle path planning. Further, cumulative-opportunity freight accessibility models are proposed to measure the service accessibility of logistics land use stakeholders while accounting for their different logistics demands. The proposed method is capable of measuring the spatiotemporal impacts of logistics suburbanization on the service accessibility of ULINs and the corresponding stakeholders. We use the real data of Beijing as a testbed and our results reveal that (1) there is considerable variation in the service accessibility of ULINs and logistics firms' service accessibility with respect to different logistics facility locations and (2) choosing logistics facilities' locations requires careful consideration of the differences in ULINs’ service accessibility to mitigate uneven service availability on the receiving side. The paper highlights the potential for freight accessibility in urban freight planning and provides effective quantitative evaluation approaches to support better practices in logistics land use and transport planning. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

We perceived a forced digital transformation, disclosure on social networks, negotiating sales through text messaging applications, electronic payments and motorcycle and bicycle delivery service. The combination of different technologies has supported small businesses in times of pandemic, since commercialisation in digital media has been one of the main solutions for the prevention of bankruptcy, particularly for physical companies.

	abstract = {As the climate change enforces decision-makers (DMs) to change established policies and strategies, investors are motivated to finance the development of green projects. Because of their environmental effects, land-use transport projects are of special importance in this process. Different types of environment-friendly land-use transportation projects are financed by the private sector or regulatory authorities and institutions. However, the choice of the correct project is a complex issue. In the decision-making process, social concerns are crucial as well as financial, technical and environmental ones. In order to solve the multi-criteria decision-making problem, we propose a novel group decision support model using the Logarithm Methodology of Additive Weights (LMAW) and Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the Compromise Solution (MARCOS) based on the fuzzy Z extension (ZE)-numbers. The proposed group decision support model has a unique capability for decision. The opinions of two groups of the DMs and experts are used to consider the decision reliability in two different stages to reach an optimal decision. To illustrate the use of model, we create a scenario that considers four small-scale green finance planning alternatives that are evaluated using twelve criteria that reflect the choice problem's economic, environmental, technical, and political aspects. According to the findings, the optimum plan should be both inclusive and equitable, as well as economically efficient. Selection of the best green finance planning involves consideration of socioeconomic variables. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper aims to reveal whether high-speed rail (HSR) can affect corporate social responsibility (CSR). First, based on difference-in-differences (DID) model, it is found that HSR promotes CSR, and the characteristics such as urban HSR kilometers (HSRM), number of cities directly connected by HSR (HSRL) and number of HSR stations (HSRS) also show a positive correlation with CSR. Second, by setting cross-effect model, it is found that HSR promotes monetary capital responsibility (MCR) by increasing government supervision pressure, promotes human capital responsibility (HCR) by promoting industrial agglomeration, and it promotes social capital responsibility (SCR) by strengthening financing screening function. From the perspective of economic geography, this paper analyzes intra-regional HSR station location effect and inter-regional CSR spillover effect. Third, through sub-sample regression, this paper analyzes the impact of intra-regional HSR stations on CSR. As HSR station-firm distance is within 10 km, HSR inhibits CSR; HSR promotes CSR as the distance is within 10–150 km; HSR inhibits CSR as the distance exceeds 150 km. Fourth, analyze the impact of inter-regional HSR on CSR spillover, HSR has a positive impact on CSR spillover, while HSR accelerates negative spillover of MCR and HCR. This study provides a theoretical basis for increasing CSR from the perspective of HSR construction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The rapid development of the Internet industry and the emergence of new business models have reshaped the spatial structure and spatial relationships of cities. The development of Internet enterprises has profoundly reshaped the established venture capital network by establishing investment departments and expanding the ecosystem in the form of venture capital.As venture capital and the Internet industry are mutually attractive and highly geographically coupled, the analysis of the structure and location of the venture capital network of Internet enterprises has become an important foundation for the development of the regional "new economy". This paper examined the spatial dynamics and location selection mechanism of venture capital activities of Chinese Internet companies by constructing a factor flow network, using spatial analysis, network analysis, and negative binomial regression models. The study demonstrated that venture capital investment in Chinese Internet enterprises has developed rapidly over the past 20 years in three phases: initial development from 2001 to 2012, rapid development from 2013 to 2016, and adjustment development from 2017 to 2019, with Internet venture capital showing the characteristics of cumulative development.Compared with traditional venture capital activities, the location choice of Internet venture capital is more concentrated, with a high concentration in a few major cities in the eastern region of China.The three major regions of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta are the main places of occurrence and association of Internet venture capital activities in China, with a significant tendency of localization of venture capital.The cumulative development of corporate venture capital and the spatial evolution of both investors and financiers have contributed to the formation of a 'core-periphery' structure of the venture capital network.In addition, an assessment of the network density of the cities where the investment and financing occurs showed that the current Internet investment and financing network is still in its developmental stage, and most of the cities are not directly connected, showing a sparse matrix.Three time windows (2012, 2015, and 2017) were selected to analyze the location selection factors of Chinese Internet venture capital in different development periods in terms of enterprise growth environment, investment proximity, and transportation accessibility. The results showed that marketization, policy guidance, investment proximity, and spatial proximity were the main forces shaping the spatial pattern of Internet venture capital activities and had different degrees of influence on the various stages of Internet industry development. This study facilitates an in-depth examination of the spatial distribution characteristics of venture capital activities in the Internet economy and provides a detailed empirical basis for understanding the changes in venture capital investments in Internet enterprises and their locational influences. © 2023 Tropical Geography.

	abstract = {This paper focuses on urban regeneration practices in central urban areas, aiming to find key points for reshaping the publicness of urban spaces by exploring the morphological features of public spaces and the spatial distribution patterns of public activities. Now that China’s urbanization process has stabilized, large-scale regeneration is no longer applicable to the current urban environment, and urban morphology has proved to be significantly useful in understanding and designing the built environment. However, current research lacks quantitative studies on morphology and public activities, and thus is hardly instructive for the cognition and design of spatial morphology in specific locations. Therefore, this paper attempts to subdivide spatial morphology at the level of “micro-renewal” or “micro-renovation” in order to explore the impact of spatial morphology on public participation in cities. The site chosen for this study is Xinjiekou in Nanjing. As a key area of two important arteries in the center of Nanjing, Xinjiekou has been a gathering place for a variety of commercial forms, such as finance, retail department stores, restaurants, and entertainment, and has been the commercial and financial center of Nanjing since the 1940s. In an on-site observation of urban development and pedestrian flow in the Xinjiekou area, the study found that despite its status as the area with the highest degree of spatial accessibility and public participation, its public space has gradually lost its attractiveness to residents, who lack a sense of participation and place identity. Based on the study of urban public spaces, both accessibility and choice play an important role in increasing public participation. Therefore, this study combined observation and quantitative analysis of Space Syntax to obtain the distribution of accessibility, choice, and public activity. Based on the results of the analysis, this research uses GWR as the statistical method to clarify the correlation between different variables. The final conclusion is that when the space type is a path with high choice value and the paths are connected, the enhancement of accessibility and choice plays an important role in promoting public participation. This statistically based empirical study of testable correlations is very helpful for the perception of location-specific spaces with high levels of interpretability and confidence. Thus, it further guides the design and has a high reference value for future spatial planning. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Studies focused on how enclosed shopping malls can attract consumers have rarely considered consumers who avoid visiting malls. The present study addresses this neglected population (approximately 12 % of consumers) to reveal their motivations and reasons for mall-avoidance behavior. A mixed-methods approach was employed. In Study 1, an exploratory content analysis of 193 qualitative transcripts identified three main reasons for avoiding malls: anti-consumption ideology, shopping irritants, and preference for alternative channels. In Study 2, 1502 respondents completed a questionnaire on their attitudes toward reasons for avoiding malls, and 449 were identified as mall avoiders. Structural equation modeling analysis indicated that atmospheric and social shopping irritants and a preference for online shopping increased avoidance behavior, whereas mall management's commitment to sustainability and a preference for high-street stores decreased avoidance behavior. Segmentation analysis identified three segments of mall avoiders (n = 449) and two segments of mall visitors (n = 1053) based on shopping preferences. The results of the segmentation analysis indicated that by enhancing sustainability commitment and improving the management of mall atmospherics, sixty percent of consumers who avoid malls can be drawn to malls. Practical implications for mall management are discussed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Walking accessibility planning is seen a powerful approach for moving towards sustainable mobility paradigms; however little attention is paid to determining which factors influence this accessibility and why. This paper addresses this gap between the theory and the practice, and evaluates how far variations in walking accessibility are related to four specific walking needs: attractiveness, comfort, safety, and ease-to-walk. Taking the ‘Centro’ district in Madrid (Spain) as a case study, exploratory scenarios are simulated by altering certain urban design factors for each walking need. Walking accessibility levels are calculated and compared across the exploratory scenarios to gain an insight into how each urban design factor affects walking accessibility. The results show a similar spatial pattern of accessibility for the four walking needs, with higher accessibility values in the north than in the south due to the greater density of destinations. Urban factors related to attractiveness and comfort are found to produce the most significant variations in walking accessibility. The paper concludes with a discussion on the practical usefulness of the findings, particularly in terms of prioritising urban design policies that increase walking accessibility levels. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {High-Speed Rail is often advertised as a sustainable alternative to air travel, and accordingly numerous initiatives for the construction of new HSR infrastructure are currently being pursued across Southeast Asia and the globe. However, beneath promises of “zero-emissions travel” frequently lie numerous hidden factors—how much steel is needed to build the railway? What energy sources are being used to generate the electricity which drives the train? Moreover, how many passengers are required for the train to be efficient relative to other forms of transport? This paper seeks to examine these questions to uncover what “hidden factors” may be present in HSR, using Vietnam’s proposed North–South Express Railway (NSER) as an example. This study calculates the CO2 emissions likely to be produced by the NSER from the construction steel and the power consumed in operation using publicly available data on the technical standards of the railway and existing data on emissions per energy source, combining this data with market size analyses of the central provinces of the proposed line based on official population and income statistics across a range of scenarios to estimate what level of ridership will be required to outperform an equivalent-length air journey. The research finds that under current projections, the HSR may emit more CO2 per end-to-end journey than a plane, that even in per-capita terms the emissions may be worse depending on the seat fill rate, and that the market size of Vietnam’s central provinces will present significant challenges in ensuring that the railway is efficient enough to outperform the plane in ridership terms. This demonstrates both the outstanding impacts of coal and other fossil fuel use in the energy mix and the potential link between environmental performance and regional inequality which constitute the hidden costs in HSR projects, and the exacerbated risks to the environment posed by inequality. © 2021 by the author.

	abstract = {Fair spatial distribution of services has always been a challenge for urban planners to supply sufficient accessibility for individuals and to consider the needs of vulnerable social groups. Nevertheless, equity assessment literature has mostly focused on measuring the accessibility through distance-based variables, and social stratification based on just income, as well. Accordingly, this study intends to employ an accessibility measure that considers non-distance-based variables along with distance-based ones. It uses multi-criteria decision-making to propose an accessibility index to assess vertical and horizontal equity of residents’ accessibility to a range of public facilities, in the district 6 of Tehran, Iran. Therefore, using the integration of geographical information system-based spatial analysis, wider people specification, and the Gini coefficient, this measure proposes a novel framework to examine the equity level of individuals belonging to the lower, middle, and upper social classes. Results imply a 0.228 Gini index for horizontal equity, which indicates a low level of inequity among residents. Besides, for vertical equity evaluation, Gini index of 0.097, 0.249, and 0.167, respectively, for lower, middle, and upper groups show people in the lower class experience very low levels of inequity, therefore higher accessibility is well distributed among groups with higher social needs. This approach can help planners to choose the right analysis method and prioritize urban decisions toward the equitable distribution of facilities. © The Author(s) 2021.},

This study has a twofold objective: (1) to identify which data variables from five well known social networks —Foursquare, Instagram, Twitter, Google Places and Airbnb— offer potential insights on the study of specific urban phenomena; and, (2) to delve into five exemplary urban topics that can be tackled by analysing the data from these social networks. Methodology Social media are analysed and specific urban issues that can be assessed through their data variables are identified. Specifically, five themes that encompass several research issues are identified through the combination of different data variables. Conclusions Data generated in social networks used for urban study purposes provide a valuable opportunity to address issues such as: [1] the use and preference for certain activities and places; [2] the image and perception of urban spaces; [3] spatiotemporal patterns of people presence and urban space-use; [4] supply and demand of economic activity; and, [5] identification of areas of concentration and specialization in the city. Originality This up to date and easily accessible information provides a thorough picture of complex issues in relation to urban dynamics that, until recently, were not easily measurable and quantifiable. Thus, the interpretation of these data broadens knowledge on city dynamics that can be useful for decision-making processes in the planning and design of the city. © 2019, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

While in the empirical literature the choice usually boils down to picking one single measure, this research proposes a flexible approach in which several measures may be used in parallel to capture the surrounding economic landscape. This is intended to acknowledge that interactions between agents may take several forms, occurring through different channels and as such being based on different measures. The methodology is applied to the location choice of establishments in the Paris region, using a mixture of ”mono-distance” hurdle-Poisson models. Seven distance measures are considered: Euclidean distance, the travel times by car (for the peak and off-peak periods) and by public transit, and the corresponding network distances. For all the economic sectors considered, the mixture of hurdle-Poisson models performs significantly better than the “pure” mono-distance models. This corroborates that local spatial spillovers are indeed channeled by different means, hence best represented using several measures. The combination of peak and off-peak road travel times (slightly) outperforms other combinations including the Euclidean distance, supporting the choice of meaningful over more abstract measures in spatial econometric models. The distance measure most likely to capture local spatial spillovers varies depending on the economic sector examined, reflecting differences between sectors in operations and location choice criteria. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

However, new and outer suburbs are often car-dependent and comparatively poorly served by other transport options. These suburbs, therefore, warrant special attention when planning for active and public transport. In Victoria, Precinct Structure Planning (PSP) is one instrument to influence active and public transport usage from the beginning. Drawing on relevant literature, document analysis and 30 interviews with stakeholders involved in the process, this paper investigates to what extent the PSP process includes active and public transport provision. The analysis is based on elements identified in the literature as being conducive to public and active transport: such as local destinations, mixed land uses, dwelling density and street connectivity. Moreover, we identify some key points of apparent tensions and trade-offs in the current PSP process concerning transport. While the PSP process is well established and has improved, there are some clear limitations to the effectiveness of planning for active and public transport, such as the low ambition for density goals. Importantly, there are also major issues beyond the actual planning process, concerning implementation, which need improvement if goals for facilitating walking, cycling and public transport use are to be met in new suburbs. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {In this paper we focus on the development of a new service model for accessing transport, namely Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and present one of the first critical analyses of the rhetoric surrounding the concept. One central assumption of one prevalent MaaS conceptualization is that transport services are bundled into service packages for monthly payment, as in the telecommunication or media service sectors. Various other forms of MaaS are being developed but all tend to offer door-to-door multi-modal mobility services, brokered via digital platforms connecting users and service operators. By drawing on literature concerned with socio-technical transitions, we address two multi-layered questions. First, to what extent can the MaaS promises (to citizens and cities) be delivered, and what are the unanticipated societal implications that could arise from a wholesale adoption of MaaS in relation to key issues such as wellbeing, emissions and social inclusion? Second, what are de facto challenges for urban governance if the packaged services model of MaaS is widely adopted, and what are the recommended responses? To address these questions, we begin by considering the evolution of intelligent transport systems that underpin the current vision of MaaS and highlight how the new business model could provide a mechanism to make MaaS truly disruptive. We then identify a set of plausible unanticipated societal effects that have implications for urban planning and transport governance. This is followed by a critical assessment of the persuasive rhetoric around MaaS that makes grand promises about efficiency, choice and freedom. Our conclusion is that the range of possible unanticipated consequences carries risks that require public intervention (i.e. steering) for reasons of both efficiency and equity. © 2019 The Authors},

Therefore, city planners, urban designers, and decision-makers require tools to predict pedestrian mobility and assess the walkability of existing or planned urban environments. For this purpose, diverse approaches have been used to analyze different inputs such as the street network configuration, density, land use mix, and the location of certain amenities. This paper focuses on the location of urban amenities as key elements for pedestrian flow prediction, and, therefore, for the success of public spaces in terms of the social life of city neighborhoods. Using agent-based modeling (ABM) and land use floor space data, this study builds a pedestrian flow model, which is applied to both existing and planned areas in the inner city of Hamburg, Germany. The pedestrian flows predicted in the planned area inform the ongoing design and planning process. The flows simulated in the existing area are compared against real-world pedestrian activity data for external validation to report the model accuracy. The results show that pedestrian flow intensity correlates to the density and diversity of amenities, among other KPIs. These correlations validate our approach and also quantify it with measurable indicators. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

We surveyed and interviewed 1610 respondents on how the epidemic changed residents’ lifestyle habits “before, during, and after COVID-19” in 12 communities in Hangzhou, China. Then, we undertook a comparative analysis and found that, under the stimulus of COVID-19, the frequency of residents using non-contact interaction had increased to varying degrees, community lifestyles had undergone significant changes, and the impact of non-contact interaction on community service facilities was complicated. Our conclusions are as following: (1) under COVID-19, the community space had become a composite space—that is, a new type of community space formed by the fusion of community physical space and community virtual space; (2) non-contact interactive activities were the main content in the community composite space, which differently influenced people’s habits of using existing community service facilities; (3) the influence mechanism was manifested in significant differences and spatial scale effects. Therefore, based on the research results, we propose a model for the configuration of service facilities in community composite spaces.

	abstract = {Informed by the design of a program in California, we make a three-part argument for why state-level governments might consider implementing direct bill-assistance programs for drinking water service to address growing affordability concerns for low-income households. State-level operation of bill-assistance programs represents a departure from the global trend of allowing water utilities to operate bill-assistance programs at their own discretion. We first explain the motivation for enhanced public sector support to help households pay for drinking water service. In state-level contexts such as California, we find that the basic household affordability equation has worsened due to an increase in the numerator of residential retail bills and a stagnation in the denominator of household incomes. We next demonstrate why direct bill assistance to households is necessary even with the presence of other system-level financial support or retail rate structure policies. Finally, we make the case that direct bill-assistance programs are best situated at the state level, due to substantial variation in systems’ capacity and demonstrated willingness to run their own robust affordability programs for vulnerable customers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This review investigates the state of the art in metrics used in energy (or fuel) and transport poverty with a view to assessing how these overlapping concepts may be unified in their measurement. Our review contributes to ongoing debates over decarbonisation, a politically sensitive and crucial aspect of the energy transition, and one that could exacerbate patterns of inequality or vulnerability. Up to 125 million people across the European Union experience the effects of energy poverty in their daily lives. A more comprehensive understanding of the breadth and depth of these conditions is therefore paramount. This review assessed 1,134 articles and critically analysed a deeper sample of 93. In terms of the use of metrics, we find that multiple indicators are better than any single metric or composite. We find work remains to be conducted in the transport poverty sphere before energy poverty metrics can be fully unified with those of transport poverty, namely the stipulation of travel standards. Without such standards, our ability to unify the metrics of both fields and potentially alleviate both conditions simultaneously is limited. The difficulties in defining necessary travel necessitate the further use of vulnerability lenses and holistic assessments focused on energy and transport services. © 2021 The Authors},

The importance of green spaces to support health and fitness in urban areas has recently regained interest. Reports released in 2010-2016 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on urban planning, environment, and health stated that green spaces can have a positive impact on physical activity, social and mental well-being, enhance air quality and decrease noise exposure. We analyzed the number of check-ins in various parks of Shanghai by utilizing geotagged social media network check-in data. This article presents a descriptive study using social media data by obtaining the three-year comparison of spatial and temporal patterns of park visits to raise public awareness that green parks provide a healthy environment that can be beneficial for the well-being of urban citizens. We investigated the visitor spatiotemporal behavior in more than 115 green parks in 10 districts of Shanghai with approximately 250,000 check-ins. We examined 3 years of geotagged data and our main findings are: (i) the spatial and temporal variations of users in urban green parks (ii) the gender differences in space and time with relation to urban green parks. The main objective of this article is to present evident data for policymakers on the advantages of providing green spaces access to urban citizens and to facilitate cities with systematic approaches to provide green space access to improve the health of urban citizens. © 2013 IEEE.},

Taking Shenyang City as our study area and using the location information of manufacturing units and automobile sales outlets extracted from points of interest (POI), we investigated the spatial relationship between the two industries from integration, correlation and coordination perspective. Based on spatial statistical analyses, the equipment manufacturing industry and the automobile sales industry in Shenyang City showed a spatial complementary integration, weak spatial correlation, and coordination with scale dependence and spatial heterogeneity in 2018. This distribution characteristic is attributed to: 1) local policy factors (i.e., that industrial land should be located in the periphery of the city or outside the Second Ring Road), and 2) the economic factors (i.e., that the degree of dependence of the equipment manufacturing industry and automobile sales industry were also influenced by external factors such as costs). These results improved the current industrial spatial relationship analysis by developing a new framework based on POI big data in order to accelerate a coordinated development between manufacturing and service industries and to promote the construction of industrial ecosystem. © 2020},

	abstract = {The coordinated development of urban transport and land use is of great practical significance to optimize urban spatial structure, reduce traffic congestion, and improve transport level. The integration of land use and transport systems is important for smart growth and sustainable development of cities. The integrated model of urban transport and land use is a key scientific support to analyze and simulate the interaction between urban transport and land use. Over the years, scholars in different countries have developed operational models that can be used for urban spatial policy formulation. However, the core algorithm of these models still need to be further improved. In this paper, the theoretical characteristics of existing mainstream models were analyzed. Based on the theoretical basis and the core algorithms, the advantages and disadvantages of six models were discussed, including spatial interaction model, urban economics and mathematical planning model, spatial input-output model, discrete choice model, micro-simulation model, and cellular automata model. A new comprehensive equilibrium model was proposed to overcome the shortcomings of the existing models. On the one hand, endogenous variable processing and dynamic feedback of the key algorithms need to be improved. On the other hand, the existing models do not fully consider the impacts of exogenous variables such as technological innovation, urban management, and urban planning policies. Therefore, new thinking was put forward for the core algorithm incorporating three key variables: Accessibility, land use characteristics, and travel cost. The equilibrium model adopts land use intensity and diversity to represent land use characteristics, and uses the improved algorithm of accessibility that takes into account the repulsive force caused by housing price and the opportunity scale of land use characteristics. In the generalized travel cost, attributes at the individual level and characteristics at the urban environment level are considered comprehensively. New algorithms were also proposed for the three modules of the integrated model, which include the residence and employment location decision module that considers incremental discrete selection process, the land supply and real estate development module that subdivides real estate types and dynamically feeds back land development results to urban land use evolution, and the comprehensive transport model that adopts improved impedance function, dynamic travel cost, and car ownership. It has important theoretical value for quantitative simulation of urban spatial evolution, prediction of trip distribution, and evaluation of urban management and planning policies. At the same time, it is of practical significance to develop the integrated model of urban transport and land use in China, so as to optimize the distribution of population and trip demand, and ease urban traffic congestion. © 2020, Science Press.

Recent studies have explored ways in which URTNs can improve traveller experiences; however, the lack of a comprehensive method to benchmark URTNs worldwide and the lack of travellers’ voices and attitudes in conceptualisation call for a new technique to identify and assess URT traveller experience. This research aimed to uncover the experiential dimensions of URT travellers from TripAdvisor reviews and to compare URTNs worldwide. The research scope included 185,485 reviews on TripAdvisor collected from 127 URTNs in 123 cities. Data were analysed using an unsupervised machine learning technique, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The analysis found eleven experiential dimensions: card, ticketing, direction, communication, architecture, network, performance, safety, crowd, connectivity and traffic. Subsequent salience-valence analyses identified factors that drive positive and negative experiences. This study presents a rapid and insightful method to assess traveller experiences.

Urban societies as socio-spatial systems are typically formed out of densely populated, well developed, productive and prosperous central areas and smaller settlements usually depended from one or more of the closest of the former. In terms of development and growth dynamics, road network lines are the basic arteries for the flow of people, economic resources and goods as well as information among places delineating to a large extent, the arrangement of transport relations and thus monocentric or polycentric organization of spatial systems. To this end, transport network quality and connectivity can generate a competitive advantage for specific locations/nodes i.e. settlements of the system. In this paper we utilize the space syntax method in order to explore the impact of transport network configuration and structure on population growth.

	abstract = {Despite an evolutionary growth in PLBV in the recent past, the study on PLBV is scarce. The present study is a novel attempt to gauge underlying purchase intention of consumers towards PLBV in developing nation like India. A PLBV purchase intention framework incorporating the online store image and consumers’ technology acceptance along with other pertinent factors has been designed and empirically validated. An online questionnaire was framed and administered to the identified survey pool followed by analysis of data using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) to validate the proposed framework. The findings unveil store image, technology acceptance, consumer innovativeness and shoppers’ value consciousness as the building blocks of attitude towards PLBV. Additionally, the result unfolds that price consciousness does not influence shoppers’ attitude towards PLBV individually. However, when other factors act in unison, the purchase intention towards PLBV increases which is remarkable in contrast to the PLB purchase intention in offline mode.

Poor infrastructure, unstable political environment, corruption, and financial constraint have been identified as some of the common obstacles facing micro, small, and medium enterprises in developing economies. With reference to Nigeria, there is paucity of information on the role of size in the perception of the above obstacles. Using the number of employees to determine size, this study attempts to bridge the gap by comparing whether there are significant differences in the perception of obstacles across firms of different sizes. The data for this study are a survey of 247 firms from 5 southern states in Nigeria. The author employed Kruskal-Wallis to test the hypotheses formulated. The findings have shown statistically significant differences on the perception of poor infrastructure and financial constraint across firm sizes. It also revealed specific obstacle(s) facing each state in southern Nigeria. The major implications of these results are that relevant authorities will be able to provide more focused interventions. © 2018 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil Canadien de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.},

	abstract = {High-speed rail is an important transportation infrastructure that can promote regional economic growth and adjust industrial layout. To explore the impact of high-speed rail construction on the industrial spatial layout of China’s Bay Area, the effects of high-speed rail construction on industrial spatial layout of the Circum-Bohai Great Bay Area, the Circum-Yangtze Estuary Great Bay Area, and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area in China were analyzed by using DID (difference-in-differences) model and quantile treatment effect based on the panel data obtained from 2005 to 2016. Results demonstrate that high-speed rail construction significantly affects industrial spatial layout of urban areas. Due to high-speed rail construction, manufacturing and real estate industries in the Circum-Bohai Great Bay Area expand greatly and show a significant diffusion effect. This diffusion promotes agglomeration of wholesale and retail, real estate, transportation, warehousing, and post industries in small cities. High-speed rail construction exhibits an agglomeration effect on financial industry in the Circum-Yangtze Estuary Great Bay Area. Highspeed rail construction facilitates clustering of manufacturing, financial, and transportation industries in small cities. The impact of high-speed rail construction on manufacturing, accommodation and catering, financial, transportation, warehousing, and post industries in Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area shows a diffusion effect. In sum, high-speed rail construction causes an evolution of industrial agglomeration in three great bay areas in China.

	abstract = {With the data collection from open data websites, global regression models with constant parameters and a local regression model with variable parameters were employed to analyze spatial characteristics between traffic accessibility and urban economic activities in the sixth-ring area of Beijing. The local regression model performs better than global regression models because of the significant spatial heterogeneity between traffic accessibility and urban economic activities. Results show that private traffic accessibility exhibits a multi-ring structure with diminishing from the center (Tian An Men Square) to the edge of the study area. And public traffic accessibility is more extensive along the rail transit lines. The spatial separation and matching phenomena between traffic accessibility and urban economic activities are coexisting. A high spatial matching appears in northwest and central regions. A sub-matching appears in the northeast and eastern regions, where assignificant separation appears in the southwest region. For spatial separation areas (e.g., Fengtai and Liangxiang), infrastructure development including road and rail lines should be paid more attention. For areas with the matching of private traffic accessibility but the separation of public traffic accessibility (e.g., Future Science City), the construction of rail lines and operation of buses should be considered. For spatial matching area (such as Zhongguancun Science City and Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area), the optimization policy for traffic management should be taken into account.

The paper adds to the spatial mismatch research by studying the metropolitan area in the U.S. South, which experienced "some of the largest decreases" in job proximity in 2012. Memphis, Tennessee, saw the disproportionately steep declines in the average employment opportunities within a typical commute distance experienced by low-income and minority residents. The paper first delineates low-income neighborhoods across the study area, then identifies commuting patterns within the three-state study area including the greater Memphis, and lastly, it compares average commute lengths by a typical and a low-income commuter, as well as the shares of resident workers with a long commute by earning category. The paper offers insight into the ways in which the changes in spatial location of employment and population within the metropolitan area may impact commuting distance for disadvantaged low-income travelers. We show low-income workers commute statistically significantly shorter distances to their places of work compared with a typical commuter. Our other results find that disadvantaged workers in Shelby County, TN, are disproportionately concentrated in lower-wage industries, such as hospitality and retail service industries, compared to overall workers. Finally, a significantly greater proportion of disadvantaged workers travel long distances of over 50 miles compared with higher-earning workers, indicating the disparity in commuting patterns between a typical resident and a low-income worker. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Cycling advocates have recently argued that low-income and minority communities across the U.S. have disproportionately low access to bike lanes. To date, however, quantitative evidence of disparities in access to bike lanes has been limited to a small number of cities. We addressed this research gap by examining cross-sectional associations between bike lanes and sociodemographic characteristics at the block group level for 22 large U.S. cities (n = 21,843 block groups). Dependent variables included the presence (yes/no), coverage, connectivity, and proximity of bike lanes, measured using secondary GIS data collected by each of the 22 cities between 2012 and 2016. Primary independent variables included indicators of race, ethnicity, educational attainment, income, poverty, and a composite socioeconomic status (SES) index, all measured using data from the 2011–2015 American Community Survey. We used linear and logistic multilevel mixed-effects regression models to estimate associations between these sociodemographic characteristics and each bike lane dependent variable, before and after adjusting for traditional indicators of cycling demand (population and employment density, distance to downtown, population age structure, bicycle commuting levels). In unadjusted associations, disadvantaged block groups (i.e. lower SES, higher proportions of minority residents) had significantly lower access to bike lanes. After adjusting for indicators of cycling demand, access to bike lanes was lower in block groups with particular types of disadvantage (lower educational attainment, higher proportions of Hispanic residents, lower composite SES) but not in those with other types of disadvantage (higher proportions of black residents, lower income, higher poverty). These results provide empirical support for advocates' claims of disparities in bike lane access, suggesting the importance of more closely considering social equity in bicycle planning and advocacy. © 2019},

	abstract = {The prosperity of ride-sharing services has rippled in the communities of GIScience, transportation, and urban planning. Meanwhile, road network structure has been analyzed from a network science perspective that focuses on nodes and relational links and aims to predictive models. However, limited empirical studies have explored the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility through such perspective. This paper utilizes the spatial Durbin model to understand the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility, proxied by Uber accessibility, through classical network measures of degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality. Taking the city of Atlanta as a case study, we have found in addition to population density and road network density, larger values of degree centrality and smaller values of closeness centrality of the road network are associated with better accessibility of Uber services. However, the effects of betweenness centrality are not significant. Furthermore, we have revealed heterogeneous effects of degree centrality and closeness centrality on the accessibility of Uber services, as the magnitudes of their effects vary by different time windows (i.e., weekday vs. weekend, rush hour in the morning vs. evening). Network science provides us both conceptual and methodological measures to understand the association between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility. In this study, we constructed road network structure measures with OpenStreetMap, which is reproducible, replicable, and scalable because of its global coverage and public availability. The study resonates with the notion of cities as the set of interactions across networks, as we have observed time-sensitive heterogeneous effects of road network structure on ride-sharing accessibility. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Amidst the growing interest in enhancing the academic understanding of the relationships between e-shopping and transport, a key element remains underexplored – the impact of e-shopping on spatial accessibility to in-store retail. The paper studies variations in multimodal accessibility to in-store retail between e-shopper groups and the associated spatial effects. The research is based on a face-to-face questionnaire, administered in the city of Alcalá de Henares (Madrid Metropolitan Area, Spain), which provides data on socio-economic characteristics, e-shopping habits, and travel time preferences to reach in-store retail. Clustering techniques serve to identify three e-shopper groups: occasional e-shoppers with a car, infrequent e-shoppers with a car, and frequent e-shoppers without a car. A comparison of e-shopper distance-decay functions to reach in-store retail is made, revealing significant differences between the three e-shopper groups for car and public transport for any time interval. However, for walking such differences are limited to time intervals between 10 and 40 minutes. Distance-decay functions are processed through a gravity-based model, identifying three main multimodal accessibility places: highly resistant places to e-shopping, moderately resistant places, and vulnerable places. Places that are highly resistant to e-shopping are mainly located in the city centre, while vulnerable places are mostly found in the city’s periphery. The paper closes with concluding remarks on policymaking and a few pathways for future research. © 2022 The Authors. Published by ELSEVIER B.V.

	abstract = {Social equity, and the contribution that transport planning can make to social equity, are increasingly attracting the attention of transport planners and researchers. This perhaps reflects the heightened levels of social inequity in cities and the concern over differential access to transport and participation in activities. This paper considers these issues by applying the Capabilities Approach to transport, in order to examine an individual’s opportunities to travel and engage in activities (capabilities) and their actual day to day travel and engagement in activities (functionings). London is selected as a case study using analysis from three Underground stations on the Jubilee Line Extension. The findings show that there are statistically significant differences in terms of capabilities and functionings across the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals, and also across different neighbourhoods in London. It is argued that unless local residents’ potential travel opportunities and actual activities, and the gaps between them, are better understood and responded to, the problem of transport-related social inequity is likely to persist in London. Therefore, we suggest that the findings from this research, including the multi-dimensional social indicators and understanding of the barriers to accessibility, could be used alongside existing approaches such as accessibility planning. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Like many cities across North America, Montréal has experienced shrinking bus ridership over recent years. Most literature has focused on the broader causes for ridership decline at the metropolitan or city level; few have considered ridership at the route level, particularly while accounting for various operational attributes and accessibility-to-jobs issues. Because service adjustments take place—and are felt by riders—at the route level, it is essential to explore bus-ridership phenomena at this same scale. Our study explores the determinants of bus ridership at the route level between 2012 and 2017 using two longitudinal random-coefficients models in Montréal. Our findings suggest that increasing the number of daily bus trips along a route and improving the average route speed are key factors in securing bus ridership gains. The service area’s regional accessibility to jobs by public transit around the route has a positive impact on bus ridership at the route level, showing the importance of land use and network structure. Additionally, our models show that reducing service frequency along a parallel route will lead to an increase in ridership along the main route. This study can be of use to transit planners and policymakers who require a more granular understanding of the factors that affect ridership at the route level. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Design/methodology/approach: Quantitative content analysis and multiple correspondence analysis are used to examine female representations in the advertising of personal care products on social media. The sample includes brand posts from 15 brands on two social media platforms. Findings: The results demonstrate that non-luxury brands use femvertising to a greater extent compared to luxury brands. In particular, this study shows that luxury brands rely more on stereotyped gender expressions and use more sexualisation in their advertising, relative to non-luxury brands. Research limitations/implications: This study provides an analysis of luxury and non-luxury brands’ femvertising practices on social media. In doing so, this study extends the study of femvertising to the context of luxury and social media, which is currently underexplored. In terms of practical implications, this study sheds light on the extent of the application of femvertising across luxury and non-luxury brands on social media. Practical implications: The findings drive a number of suggestions for luxury marketers, including the use of more independent gender roles and more racial diversity in their social media advertising and the lessening of unrelated sexuality. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to compare femvertising practices of luxury and non-luxury brands on social media, delineating different facets of femvertising (e.g. gender roles, diversity, etc.) and extending scholarly understanding of the possible facets of this concept. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, the establishment of minimum accessibility requirements and the identification of accessibility thresholds for population groups remain as key methodological barriers. This paper contributes to addressing these shortcomings by using Retail Mobility Environments as an analytical and geographical concept to identify advantageous and disadvantageous non-motorised accessibility to retail for different population groups. The city of Zaragoza, Spain provides the spatial laboratory for experimentation, and the study focuses on four target groups: the young employed, the young unemployed, seniors, and adults. The results reveal social and spatial inequalities in the distribution of non-motorised accessibility in Zaragoza, with marked negative effects on the young unemployed and adults. On the other hand, seniors and the young employed are the groups that benefit from the current setup. It is finally discussed on the capacity of the proposed methodology for exploring both social and spatial inequalities, for establishing minimum accessibility requirements, and for identifying accessibility thresholds according to different population groups. Furthermore, the convenience of linking equity issues to non-motorised accessibility is also highlighted. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Geographic information systems (GIS) are often used to examine the association between both physical activity and nutrition environments, and children’s health. It is often assumed that geospatial datasets are accurate and complete. Furthermore, GIS datasets regularly lack metadata on the temporal specificity. Data is usually provided ‘as is’, and therefore may be unsuitable for retrospective or longitudinal studies of health outcomes. In this paper we outline a practical approach to both fill gaps in geospatial datasets, and to test their temporal validity. This approach is applied to both district council and open-source datasets in the Taranaki region of Aotearoa New Zealand. Methods: We used the ‘streetview’ python script to download historic Google Street View (GSV) images taken between 2012 and 2016 across specific locations in the Taranaki region. Images were reviewed and relevant features were incorporated into GIS datasets. Results: A total of 5166 coordinates with environmental features missing from council datasets were identified. The temporal validity of 402 (49%) environmental features was able to be confirmed from council dataset considered to be ‘complete’. A total of 664 (55%) food outlets were identified and temporally validated. Conclusions: Our research indicates that geospatial datasets are not always complete or temporally valid. We have outlined an approach to test the sensitivity and specificity of GIS datasets using GSV images. A substantial number of features were identified, highlighting the limitations of many GIS datasets. © 2021, The Author(s).},

In this study, an attempt is made to study the geographic distribution of the various categories of healthcare facilities in the city of Thiruvananthapuram, South India using the centrographic analysis that includes the Mean Center, Standard Deviational Ellipse and Average Nearest Neighbour and it was found that there is an uneven distribution. Network-based point pattern analysis is also performed and cross k-function is used to determine the distribution of medical shops relative to the healthcare services. A weighted node approach is used to calculate the indices of centrality by weighing all nodes based on their degree using Geographical Information System (GIS). Multi centrality assessment model consisting of betweenness, closeness and straightness centrality is used to compute the weighted road centrality on a local and global scale. Kernel Density Estimation technique is applied to modify the centrality values and the vector points to a basic raster framework. Correlation analysis was performed to find the role of the network centrality on the location of healthcare facilities in the study area. Correlation values are greatest among category 2 hospitals; straightness centrality and betweenness centrality favours the location of category 1 hospitals and homeopathy hospitals respectively. The results confirm that network topology influences the location of medical facilities in the study area. © 2021, Korean Spatial Information Society.},

Although previous studies have proposed various accessibility indicators, they are mostly static in nature, capturing only the spatial dimension of accessibility. The advancement of the research agenda in activity-based studies calls for improved accessibility measures that can capture urban dynamics and human activity-travel patterns at more fine-grained resolutions, both spatially and temporally. In this paper, we draw on the rich spatial and temporal information from online crowdsourcing data on points-of-interest and propose a set of new measures of accessibility to opportunities and services that incorporate the dynamics of businesses environment in Singapore. The new measures consider both the spatial distribution of business establishments and their open time over the day. We then feed the new and traditional accessibility measures into destination choice models to assess whether capturing the temporal variation in accessibility and business environment help to improve the model performance. We find that the model with dynamic accessibility measures outperforms models with traditional static accessibility measures. The results suggest that travelers are likely to consider both the spatial and temporal dimensions of accessibility when choosing destinations for their activities. The proposed dynamic accessibility measures contribute to the research and planning for accessibility by capturing the temporal dimension of accessibility that are not sufficiently addressed in traditional urban built environment measures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The aim of this study was to perform spatiotemporal data analysis to identify transit desert areas in Seoul in three steps. First, the transit gap between peak and off-peak hours is evaluated and various spatial changes in each temporal transit desert area are identified. Second, a spatial analysis is conducted to identify transit desert and transit oasis areas that emerge during peak hours. Lastly, an independent T-test is conducted to identify how the socio-economic characteristics of transit deserts and transit oases are statistically different. Our analysis show that, transit deserts changed across space and over the time in Seoul. Furthermore, transit deserts in general appear to be associated with socio-economically vulnerable residential areas. © 2021},

Automated parcel lockers are a way to improve delivery efficiency, but despite their rapid growth, little is known about their accessibility and equity impacts. Among e-commerce players in the U.S., Amazon stands out by its large market share. This research studies the location of Amazon lockers in Portland, Oregon utilizing highway, land use, employment, and sociodemographic datasets. Geographical tools and cluster analysis are utilized to estimate accessibility and equity metrics. Lockers tend to be located in mixed-use areas and can be utilized by a large percentage of the population. However, the equity metrics indicate that the current distribution of lockers could be improved to reach traditionally underserved populations. Given the environmental and economic advantages of lockers, policymakers should encourage the expansion of this type of last mile solution to avoid market failures in areas that are currently underserved. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

It presents changes in accessibility that have occurred in the 2014-2020 programming period with particular attention to the effects of the road transport policy implemented at the regional level, assessed using potential accessibility indicators. Indicators were calculated at the intra-national level (destinations within the country) and at the regional level (destinations only in the Podlaskie Voivodeship). The basic research unit was the municipality. The effects are understood here as both a general improvement in accessibility, that is, an increase in the indicator value for the region and for individual units, and its geographic reach. This brings in the additional objective of assessing EU-supported investment programmes on how they reduce the peripherality of a region in a given state and of the region’s inner peripheries within the region itself. The study conclusions indirectly demonstrate the need for a flexible transport policy in peripheral areas, both at the EU and the member state levels. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Elisabetta Vitale Brovarone, Giancarlo Cotella, and Luca Staricco.},

	abstract = {In a context where the demand and supply of mail and parcel delivery services are undergoing major changes due to the widespread use of the Internet and digital communications, this paper focuses on the accessibility of postal services through the physical retail network. The accessibility constraints applied to the outlets network of Le Groupe La Poste (the French postal operator responsible for the universal postal service and three other services of general economic interest) are based on a “simplified” approach that considers accessibility only in terms of time or distance-time. This paper proposes to measure potential spatial accessibility by applying postal supply and potential demand dimensions using a two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) analysis. Based on an equilibrium between supply and demand through distance function, this method, which is often used in studies of the accessibility of health services, is transposed and adapted into the field of postal activities. It aims to measure accessibility by taking into account the population and population/provider ratio, considering standard postal services provided at service points. While until recently the 2SFCA methods were mostly applied in healthcare contexts, some applications have been developed in non-health-related services over the last decade. This paper proposes an original contribution to analysing variations in the accessibility of postal services. Referring to the “primary postal services” (sales of stamps, letters or parcels postage, remittance of postal items, and so on), it outlines the conditions that activities (or services) must satisfy in order to use the floating catchment area method. © 2020 The Author(s).

Walking routes from residences to parks, in terms of duration and perception, have received insufficient attention in the literature, particularly in the urban form context in China. Using the case study of Xuanwu Lake Park in Nanjing, we acquire walking routes from residences to the park through open-source data scraping in order to depict the pedestrian shed and pedestrian environment reasonably along these routes. The results show that the walking routes vary significantly with regards to distance, turns, street views, and so on. Proximity to urban parks, in terms of Euclidean distance, does not necessarily correspond to actual route distance, which may have a more direct influence on travel convenience and, hence, visiting propensity. Palpable differences in green visual ratio, image elements, and points of interest along these routes may also contribute to pedestrian environmental disparity. Analyzing data obtained from an online map provides a rapid and objective approach to detect pedestrian sheds and diagnose pedestrian environments, which can facilitate urban planners and policy makers in siting new parks and assessing the service capacity of parks. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The dependence of urban bus transit on their covered streets is expected to be significant and heterogeneous in megacities. Using a bipartite network approach, we develop several weighted centrality-based connectivities to quantify the degree of dependencies of urban bus transit on streets. Two megacities with different road patterns, i.e., Beijing and Shanghai in China are taken as examples to depict comparatively spatial inequalities of the centrality-based dependencies at both local and global scales. Then, a series of spatial cross-section regression models are introduced to explore the colocation relationships between the dependencies of bus transit and urban socioeconomic intensities. The methodology of kernel density estimation (KDE) is used to convert all data with different scales into the same unit of measurement. Results indicate that there are significant statistical and spatial inequalities of the centrality-based dependencies of bus transit on urban streets. These inequalities with evident hierarchies, variances and clusters were validated by statistical analysis including power-law function, rank-size distribution, multiple variance indices, together with Global Moran's I. Besides, a majority of bus transit rely heavily on minor streets concentrating on circumferential expressways in central urban areas and radial highways oriented to outer suburbs under industrial or residential suburbanization. The unequal distribution is found to be strongly related to population, nighttime light intensity, transport-related services, and commercial and leisure services by the spatial regression models. A good spatial matching between bus routes' dependencies and socioeconomic activities intensities is found both in these two megacities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Tricity is a specific area in Poland because of the geographical location, landscape, access to the sea, access to a few container terminals and being an agglomeration. That is why both for inhabitants and local businesses city logistics issues are particularly important. The need for more sustainable transportation and integrative planning processes in cities, has been widely developed since 2013 when Urban Mobility Package set up a concept for SUMP (Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans) Within this idea, EU provides financial support for urban mobility projects. So various city logistics’ solutions are implemented but with a different level of success. City logistics measures have in fact their weaknesses and strengths. It is rather challenging to find an optimal solution because it is difficult to take into account the complexity and diversity of urban logistics while keeping all sides engaged. City logistics seems to be a quite difficult issue, mostly because it contains several levels of complexity. Not only it refers to the diversity of the goods transported and heterogeneity of the transportation means, but also involves multiple stakeholders. The most important are authorities, transportation operator, retailers and residents. These stakeholders most often represent different aims and priorities. While local authorities are interested in reducing pollution, congestion or noise, transportation operators and retailers are mainly focused on keeping costs under control while maintaining service levels. In the study, in-depth interviews technique with various stakeholders of city logistics was used. The interview was based on a questionnaire consisting of open and closed questions. One scale question assessed the importance of a given dimension of sustainable urban logistics for the particular stakeholder. This approach made it possible to identify the priorities of individual stakeholder groups. The respondents were a few individual stakeholders for each group identified within the literature review. To address the aim of the study, to analyse gathered data, both qualitative and quantitative methods were implemented. Among the qualitative methods, the Delphi method, text analysis and text mining techniques were used to identify the main characteristics of stakeholders opinions. Then, to draw the detailed results for each group, the Kruskal-Wallis test was held, equivalent to ANOVA, but not requiring normal distribution of variables, impossible to achieve at small sizes of stakeholder groups samples. The Kruskal-Wallis test allowed identifying similarities and differences between the priorities of the studied groups in light of the research problem being examined. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Based on these distribution laws, statistics and spatial measurement are used to measure and compare the theoretical accessibility and actual accessibility of these lakeside areas at different grid scales in order to estimate the recreational development potential and explore the causes and possible suggestions behind the recreational potential. Results show that Ziyang Lake, Shai Lake, and South Lake have great recreational potential in improving their accessibility, whereas the Hankou lake dense area has a saturated recreational development potential due to its high accessibility characteristics. The differences in the water environment, surrounding road traffic conditions, and construction situations in these lakes influence their accessibility. Some differences are also observed between the actual and theoretical accessibility of most of these lakes, and there is a long way to go for real improvement of their recreational development potential. To better exploit the recreational development potential, improving the accessibility of these lakes remains an important issue that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. © 2019 by the authors.},

This study determines whether new urban place selection—that is, the selection of places in a way that differs from the classic locational principle of land use—occurs via SNS by examining changes in the location of Food and Beverage(F&B) retail facilities patronized by citizens daily. More specifically, this study employs spatial and quantitative analyses to investigate location selection of F&B customers, which respond most sensitively to place selection, in six metropolitan cities in South Korea. The results show phenomena indicating that the place selection pattern via SNS was different spatially and quantitatively from that via the established retail location principle. The location of F&B retail facilities most commonly selected via SNS is largely shaped by small-scale and hierarchically lower roads near existing commercial area and is unaffected by land price and distance from public transportation. These findings sufficiently contradict the general location principle in terms of the location characteristics of F&B retail facilities. As such, this study reveals a novel behavior pattern regarding place selection based on SNS. F&B retail facilities should be prepared to adapt to changing consumer behavior. Moreover, this fact indicates that the consideration of gradual changes in the selection of urban project sites, development of land use plans, and calculation of rent for retail is needed in light of advancements in SNS. © 2020},

	abstract = {Understanding what aspects of the urban environment are associated with better socioeconomic/liveability outcomes is a long standing research topic. Several quantitative studies have investigated such relationships. However, most of such works analysed single correlations, thus failing to obtain a more complete picture of how the urban environment can contribute to explain the observed phenomena. More recently, multivariate models have been suggested. However, they use a limited set of metrics, propose a coarse spatial unit of analysis, and assume linearity and independence among regressors. In this paper, we propose a quantitative methodology to study the relationship between a more comprehensive set of metrics of the urban environment and the valorisation of street segments that handles non-linearity and possible interactions among variables, through the use of Machine Learning (ML). The proposed methodology was tested on the French Riviera and outputs show a moderate predictive capacity (i.e., adjusted (Formula presented.)) and insightful explanations on the nuanced relationships between selected features of the urban environment and street values. These findings are clearly location specific; however, the methodology is replicable and can thus inspire future research of this kind in different geographic contexts. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Evaluating spatial inequalities using a single walking accessibility measure is quite challenging. In response, the paper proposes combining two accessibility measures (real and potential) to provide additional insights into the identification and mapping of spatial inequalities. The municipality of Getafe in the Madrid Metropolitan Area, Spain serves as a case study. A questionnaire, administered via face-to-face interviews, recorded the resident’s walking preferences for reaching in-store retail. A gravity-based model was used to calculate real and potential accessibilities, which were combined to map four accessibility places that originate spatial inequalities: advantageous, moderately advantageous, moderately disadvantageous, and disadvantageous. The results suggest that potential accessibility values are higher than real accessibility values, and the final map shows the city centre residents (mostly seniors) benefit from the advantageous accessibility places. Disadvantageous places are mainly found in the city’s periphery, where younger people live. © 2021 The Author(s).

The public transport model is based on the GTFS data (General Transit Feed Specification), while the car model has been created from data on driving times derived from Google Maps® API. Both models presented in the article have been constructed for a specified period of time, namely from 5.00 am to 10.00 pm in 15-min intervals. The analysis of the above-mentioned models has allowed the comparison of differences in potential accessibility and its deviations at different times of the day. The disparities revealed by the study have indicated that there are certain times of the day when public transport is actually competitive with the private means of transport.

The authors propose a method to quantify access to OHDS and assess levels of inequalities in access to OHDS using data from OHDS providers in the pharmaceutical and food sectors, as well as from transport operators delivering parcels. The Västra Götaland Region in the West coast of Sweden is used as a case study. The results show significant inequalities in access to OHDS. Moreover, there are segments of population under a compound marginalization during the COVID-19 pandemic due to (i) limited accessibility to OHDS services, (ii) high incidence of COVID-19 cases in their area that makes physical visits to a store a risk activity, and (iii) high vulnerability (e.g., high share of individuals older than 65). These results reveal a need for the public sector to prioritize innovations in services that target specific clusters of the population that are vulnerable and marginalized, but also shows the imminent risk for some of these segments during the pandemic. © 2021 The Author(s)},

Such inequality is perpetuated by land-use patterns still influenced by the apartheid past. The resulting urban form necessitates long travel distances, often relying on fragmented transit modes, each with their own geographical and temporal constraints. This study applies work on transit deserts in cities in the global north to Cape Town, aiming to assess the methodological transferability to the global south, and generating case study results. In the Cape Town case, the study first analyses transit deserts based on formal public transport supply (bus rapid transit, traditional bus and train), identifying that ten out of 18 traffic analysis zones were classified as transit gaps (some unserved demand), while three of these zones qualified as transit deserts (significant undersupply). Like its U.S. counterparts, excess supply is found near Cape Town’s city centre. In Cape Town, the transit gaps/deserts are partly filled by unscheduled minibus-taxis. When this informal public transport service is added, the transit deserts disappear; however, half of the transport analysis zones still qualify as having transit gaps. It is, therefore, concluded that informal public transit in Cape Town reduces the transit gap, but does not eliminate it. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Current simulation systems face simplifications of personal behaviour, zonal patterns, non-optimisation of public transport trips (choice of the fastest option only), and do not work with real targets and their characteristics. The new TRAMsim system uses a Monte Carlo approach, which evaluates all possible public transport and walking origin-destination (O-D) trips for k-nearest stops within a given time interval, and selects appropriate variants according to the expected scenarios and parameters derived from local surveys. For the city of Ostrava, Czechia, two commuting models were compared based on simulated movements to reach (a) randomly selected large employers and (b) proportionally selected employers using an appropriate distance-decay impedance function derived from various combinations of conditions. The validation of these models confirms the relevance of the proportional gravity-based model. Multidimensional evaluation of the potential accessibility of employers elucidates issues in several localities, including a high number of transfers, high total commuting time, low variety of accessible employers and high pedestrian mode usage. The transport accessibility evaluation based on synthetic trips offers an improved understanding of local situations and helps to assess the impact of planned changes. © 2019 by the authors.},

It attempts to establish the existence of an effect of VCC implementation on these sources of strategy, as well as the intensity of the effect. The study's data were collected via self-administered questionnaires from 484 tourists on their return home. Through structural equation modelling, we tested our research hypotheses. The research results indicate that transparency and risk affect a hotel guest's perceptions of price and quality, while access only determines the quality. Contrary to what we expected, dialogue did not have a positive influence on the perceived price or perceived quality. Finally, the results support the notion that perceived quality affects the perceived price. As a firm-orientated model, the DART model was applied to the customer context for the first time in this study, which contributes to the marketing literature. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Cities and towns have often developed infrastructure that enabled a variety of socio-economic interactions. Street networks within these urban settings provide key access to resources, neighborhoods, and cultural facilities. Studies on settlement scaling have also demonstrated that a variety of urban infrastructure and resources indicate clear population scaling relationships in both modern and ancient settings. This article presents an approach that investigates past street network centrality and its relationship to population scaling in urban contexts. Centrality results are compared statistically among different urban settings, which are categorized as orthogonal (i.e., planned) or self-organizing (i.e., organic) urban settings, with places having both characteristics classified as hybrid. Results demonstrate that street nodes have a power law relationship to urban area, where the number of nodes increases and node density decreases in a sub-linear manner for larger sites. Most median centrality values decrease in a negative sub-linear manner as sites are larger, with organic and hybrid urban sites' centrality being generally less and diminishing more rapidly than orthogonal settings. Diminishing centrality shows comparability to modern urban systems, where larger urban districts may restrict overall interaction due to increasing transport costs over wider areas. Centrality results indicate that scaling results have multiples of approximately 1/6 or 1/3 that are comparable to other urban and road infrastructure, suggesting a potential relationship between different infrastructure features and population in urban centers. The results have implications for archaeological settlements where urban street plans are incomplete or undetermined, as it allows forecasts to be made on past urban sites' street network centrality. Additionally, a tool to enable analysis of street networks and centrality is provided as part of the contribution. © 2021 Altaweel et al.

	abstract = {The disconnection between land use and transport planning has been identified as one of the main factors for the low and unequal levels of accessibility to activities in Brazilian metropolises. In this article, the impacts of Fortaleza's urban legislation are analyzed on road density, on land-use diversity, and, consequently, on sociospatial inequalities in access to activities over the city's territory. For that, a literature review was initially undergone, addressing studies focused on the relationship between urban accessibility and land-use diversity. Then, Fortaleza's LUOS (1996) was presented and discussed, allowing to raise empirical hypotheses about the phenomena under study. Finally, the proposed hypotheses were investigated by means of indicators capable of measuring them, supported by diagnostic exploratory analyses of the patterns of spatial dependence observed in the city. In short, the results found in this research indicate that the LUOS (1996), by means of its deliberations, has interfered in the spatial distribution of land use in Fortaleza, not being able, though, to reduce the existing inadequacies and, as a consequence, contributing to maintaining a state of inequality in the accessibility to activities between different socioeconomic groups. © 2022 Editora CHAMPAGNAT.

The results of structural equation model analysis with 438 bike sharing service users in China reveal that altruism, rewards, and user knowledge enhance both in-and extra-role participa-tions, whereas perceived ease of use promotes only user in-role participation, and both user satisfaction and commitment increase only user extra-role participation. Rewards are also found to pro-mote user satisfaction, ultimately increasing user commitment.

When population and facilities are not uniformly distributed across the landscape, inequities in accessibility may occur. Current research into GIS-based accessibility measures has focused primarily on spatial inequities between different geographic locations but not directly on differences in accessibility between subgroups of the population. The research presented here develops a new method for measuring differential accessibility to facilities between various segments of the population. The method extends concepts and techniques in spatial point pattern analysis that account for the spatial structure of demand and its relationship to supply. In this approach, the traditional Lorenz curve and its associated indices, the Gini coefficient and the dissimilarity index, which are used to measure inequality, are recast in spatial terms for measuring differences in accessibility between population subgroups. An analysis of spatial accessibility to grocery stores in Akron, OH illustrates the value of the spatial Lorenz curve and its associated indices compared to other methods. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Indeed, investments in High Speed Rail (HSR) have been significant and new projects are going to be built around the world. Fast trains represent comfortable, safe, flexible and eco-sustainable means of transport both for people and goods. There is a classification of the effects induced by HSR services, according to which they can be grouped into: impacts on the transport system (internal), socio-economic impacts (external) and environmental impacts (external). Much less studied, however, are the impacts on accessibility. Users living in a given area, characterized by low accessibility to transport, will consequently have low accessibility to job opportunities, health and educational facilities, services, etc. Based on the previous considerations, the purpose of this paper is to study and analyze the impacts on accessibility induced by the introduction of HSR services in four European countries, i.e. Spain, France, Germany and Italy. The main findings show that HSR has brought an increase of accessibility. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Background: Taxi services have played an essential role in the transport system as they contribute to urban mobility. With the rapid development of information and communication technologies, ride-hailing services, one of the typical sharing economy forms of road transport, have become increasingly popular. The uptake of app-based technologies that support the sharing economy for transport is considered to threaten the future of traditional taxi services directly. Aim: This study aims to compare the direct and indirect effects of factors such as perceived benefits of booking method, perceived safety, involvement and satisfaction on the loyalty of passengers to ride-hailing and traditional taxi services. Method: A structural equation model of the relationships among these constructs was tested using data collected from 545 respondents (263 ride-hailing passengers and 282 traditional taxi passengers) who have used these services at least once a month in Vietnam. Results: The results have confirmed that there was a strong relationship between satisfaction and loyalty for ride-hailing as well as traditional taxi services. It was also evident that the variable describing the perceived benefits of booking method was the second strongest factor influencing traditional taxi passengers’ loyalty while the perception of safety was the second most important determinant of ride-hailing passengers’ loyalty. Conclusions: Results from this investigation offer insights for the development of strategies aiming at increasing the loyalty of ride-hailing as well as traditional taxi users. By focusing on the strengths and improving the weaknesses of each transport service, these two services can be complementary and co-existing without cannibalising each other. In turn this will lead to a transport system capable to serve all types of users. © 2021 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies},

	abstract = {Melbourne’s population is diverse and predicted to grow rapidly; its infrastructure must reflect these changes. Engineers have a responsibility to create solutions to this phenomenon that cater to the diverse needs of their users. The current political appetite for infrastructure development presents an opportunity to improve Melbourne’s ability to accommodate everyone by applying inclusive solutions to infrastructure design, improving the overall sustainability and liveability of Melbourne. In the engineering industry, infrastructure often reflects those designing it, and not the society it intends to serve. This must change if the benefits of infrastructure and associated economic investments are to be fully realised. From a strategic standpoint, social, legislative, economic and political consequences will impact the city long into the future. This paper discusses the extent to which Melbourne is an ‘inclusive city’ and aims to explore how the city can apply inclusive solutions in the context of diversity and in future infrastructure investment. It considers how opportunities for inclusiveness in infrastructure may be restricted by the homogeneity of the engineering industry, and the importance of fostering diversity in engineering to combat this phenomenon. It suggests practical solutions to achieve a holistic approach to inclusivity, supplementing Melbourne’s existing strategic frameworks and policies. © 2019, © 2019 Engineers Australia.},

	abstract = {Accessibility is a well-known basic term in spatial science and planning and is inherently related to functional aspects of places and geographical systems. Therefore, accessibility analysis is considered to be an important tool for defining and explaining regional divisions, as well as for enhancing spatial planning policy. However, as Batty (2009, p. 192) has indicated there are differences between accessibility potential of places and the actual distribution of performance or activities of people and these differences can vary with changes in scale. However, previous studies have examined functional systems and spatial accessibility with little attention to the association among them across geographical scales. Our study attempts to fill this gap and to explore the emergence of spatial accessibility and how relates to the formation of a functional system. The aim of this study is to achieve a better understanding of how spatial accessibility relates to the formation of functional systems at different spatial scales of national systems. Using the space syntax methodology, spatial accessibility was analyzed for the entire national road network of Israel across different geographic scales – from local culminating in the national scale. The analysis was based on angular segment analyses of the road center-line network. Following this, the correlation between spatial accessibility across scale and functional regions was examined, as defined by employment and commuting flows. Exploration of the relationship resulted in a spatial organization connected to the functional systems in Israel. This shows significant correspondence and exposes transitions between local, regional and national spatio-functional systems, as follows. First, a significant correlation between local (2km radius) accessibility levels of settlements with the number of employees and commuters. Second, the regional (15-20km radius) accessibility is highly correlated to the emergence of the main employment centers. As part of those centers, particularly noticeable is the functional dominance of the four metropolitan areas. Third, the main metropolitan areas are integrated at higher scale (from 30km radius) and form together a core region characterized by high accessibility, with a clear distinction from this outer region characterized by relatively low accessibility. This spatial structure conforms to the center-periphery structure at the national level of Israel. Additionally, the commuting flow patterns reveal that the core region is relatively well connected, especially the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, which is also characterized by dominant accessibility. In contrast, no substantial commuting flows were found within the periphery, as well as between periphery-core as would be expected from the low accessibility of the area. It seems that the core region functions at multiple scales (local-regional-national) while the periphery functions only at a local scale. The national accessibility reflects well the separation between the two spatio-functional systems. These findings indicate a close relationship with functional performance across geographical scales and accessibility potentials. They also reinforce the importance of accessibility analysis as an indicator for defining and explaining the functional organization of the entire road network at the urban, regional and national scales. © 2019 Beijing JiaoTong University.

East Beijing, and in particular the district of Guomao, is used as a case study, to illustrate features of a relatively wealthy area with abundant transport resources. The research analysis shows that capabilities and functionings differ according to an individual's socio-economic characteristics.

The paper studies variations in multimodal accessibility to in-store retail between e-shopper groups and the associated spatial effects. The research is based on a face-to-face questionnaire, administered in the city of Alcalá de Henares (Madrid Metropolitan Area, Spain), which provides data on socio-economic characteristics, e-shopping habits, and travel time preferences to reach in-store retail. Clustering techniques serve to identify three e-shopper groups: occasional e-shoppers with a car, infrequent e-shoppers with a car, and frequent e-shoppers without a car. A comparison of e-shopper distance-decay functions to reach in-store retail is made, revealing significant differences between the three e-shopper groups for car and public transport for any time interval. However, for walking such differences are limited to time intervals between 10 and 40 min. Distance-decay functions are processed through a gravity-based model, identifying five categories of multimodal accessibility places that provide information on how in-store retail locations may be affected by e-shopping habits. The paper closes with concluding remarks on policy-making and a few pathways for future research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Accessibility planning is a crucial alternative to mobility planning for reaching sustainable outcomes. Although there is a vast literature on accessibility, less attention is paid to accessibility as a relative concept, i.e., its relationship with the socio-economic characteristic of the population. While accessibility is known to vary by location, it also changes as a consequence of differences in individual willingness to reach destinations by certain transport modes. Using the city of Zaragoza, Spain as a case study, this paper evaluates relative non-motorized accessibility (walking and cycling) to three types of retail activities: daily, weekly, and incidental. First, a clustering process is used to identify four population groups according to their socio-economic characteristics (the young employed; the young unemployed; seniors and adults). Second, distance-decay functions based on time-willingness to reach retail destinations by non-motorized modes are compared between the four clusters of population. Third, relative accessibility maps based on gravity-based models are elaborated, highlighting places that exhibit statistical differences between the population clusters. The results indicate that willingness to reach retail stores on foot by seniors (>65 years old) was significantly different from the rest of groups analyzed, providing additional insights on how relative accessibility measurements can anticipate potential social exclusion risks. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

A method is proposed to evaluate the equity of spatial accessibility to library resources and services across population groups. Spatial accessibility is measured in two ways: the closest-based and quantity-based measurements that respectively characterize the level of accessibility to the closest one and to diverse resources according to travel distance and travel time in road networks. Two approaches are applied for equity evaluation with socioeconomic and demographic indicators of census tracts, including the minority population, non-adults, and population in poverty. The method is applied to examine the physical locations of public libraries in four major cities of the U.S with diverse population composition. Results show spatial inequity for socially disadvantaged populations in the cities of Washington DC, Baltimore, and Chicago. Inequity is more prominent for non-adults and minority populations in DC and Baltimore. The analysis helps identify the potential inequity for subpopulations and guide the decision-making in library services to improve equity and inclusion. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

Meanwhile, new and complex travel behavior trends are emerging, in part due to the development and spread of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) but also in response to other external influences and to technological change within the transport sector. These trends may better be understood through a more holistic view of accessibility: online and via transport modes, in time and in space. This chapter reviews the literature exploring the influence of both daily weather parameters and severe weather events on travel behavior and activity participation. It then considers the parallels and interdependencies between the ICT and transport sectors, and finally reframes existing research into the impact of ICT on productivity, lifestyles, and travel behavior in order to demonstrate the potential for ICT to reduce the level of risk from severe weather impacts for different groups and individuals, increase their ability and propensity to choose more resilient options, and improve adaptation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, stay-at-home orders in conjunction with working from home, school closures, and event cancellations resulted in a decrease in travel demand. Under normal circumstances, these activities are components of trip chains and utilize a multimodal transport network. The overall performance of the network can be traced through delays in the bus system as buses capture both changes in ridership and fluctuations in mixed traffic conditions. This paper explores the hypothesis that resumption of a single component in trip chains (i.e., school reopening) is sufficient for a measurable change in transport system performance. This study used school reopening in Sydney, Australia as a case study to explore whether school-related trips affected bus system performance directly with higher student patronage or indirectly with heavier road congestion from parental car trips. Both stop dwell times and differences in delays between successive stops were used as bus service indicators. Dwell times reflect the travel demand for buses and delay differences capture local changes in service reliability. We found that increase in ridership had limited impacts on bus punctuality. However, the level of local bus performance worsened after schools reopened, and the effect was more pronounced in commercial areas in the afternoon when schools ended, suggesting secondary trip purposes such as leisure and shopping in addition to school pick-ups. This study revealed the interaction between different trip purposes during the postshutdown period and threw light on changes in travel behavior patterns as travel restrictions were relaxed in pandemic circumstances. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.},

	abstract = {This study presents evidence on two factors of the built environment affecting Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) demand at a station level throughout the day. These factors were examined in Bogotá, one of the most densely populated cities in the world, and its BRT system, which operates with high levels of congestion. We proposed an approach to explain how changes in density and mixed activities influence ridership levels. We found that high population and job densities relate to a higher number of BRT boardings in the morning and evening peak hours, respectively. However, these effects decrease in magnitude when both uses are present in the same zone. We found evidence that a balanced mixture of jobs and residences reduces the pressure on BRT boardings. An analysis of the changes during the day and differentiating between working days and weekends indicates that the cause of a balanced ridership lies in the internal capture of job-related trips. We hypothesize that the density and diversity characteristics central to the theory of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD), drive self-containment patterns around public transport catchment areas, alleviating BRT congestion. Using these results, we show how changes in the proposed land-use pattern limits can have different effects on the BRT ridership. Our results underscore the need of incorporating the TOD concept as an instrument for the management of public transport systems in dense and segregated cities and emphasize the importance of achieving a balance between jobs and housing to support less congested high-capacity public transport systems. © 2020},

	abstract = {This paper aims to compare walking accessibility levels between groceries and other types of retail for seniors, examining whether patterns are uniform (or not). The city of Granada, Spain served as case study. First, a questionnaire was administered with persons older than 55 years, assessing their willingness to reach different types of retail opportunities on foot. A total of 202 valid responses were obtained (171 face-to-face and 31 online): 56% women, average age 69 years old, 20% living alone, and average monthly family income between €1000-€2000. Second, the K-modes clustering algorithm was used to identify four seniors sub-groups: “non-motorized seniors between 65 and 75”, “motorized seniors between 65 and 75”, “non-motorized seniors older than 75”, and “motorized seniors younger than 65”. The variables used were: age, car availability, household income, and household composition. Third, by using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (p-level <0.05), a comparison of time-willingness functions to walk to retail was made between seniors sub-groups. The results revealed that walking accessibility to groceries are not significantly different among those sub-groups, while the accessibility levels to weekly retail are significantly lower for the “motorized seniors younger than 65” for time-willingness slots of 20–30 min.

Three studies use a variety of brand cues in both laboratory and field contexts to test the effect of head canting on brand power evaluations, the role of a person's physical height as a moderator and boundary condition, and the mediating role of consumer–brand identification. Study 1, an experiment, showed that tall, but not short individuals, evaluate a brand as more powerful when looking up (rather than down) at a brand story from a standing position, with differences in brand power impacting brand attitudes and choice. Study 2 replicates these findings with 30 brands, consumers positioned in a seated position, and brand logos. Both studies rule out the construal level as a process mediator. Study 3 further examines the process and demonstrates that the interaction of head canting with a person's height impacts consumer–brand identification, which mediates brand evaluations.

To consolidate extant research on the benefits of relationship marketing for customers, this meta-analysis integrates 1242 effect sizes drawn from 235 independent samples across 224 papers disseminated in the past two decades. The results reveal that all three relational benefits affect loyalty, though confidence benefits and social benefits have the strongest effects. Among the three identified mediation paths through which relational benefits influence customer loyalty, the sequential path through perceived value and relationship quality is the strongest.

	abstract = {Cities are continuing to develop and are grappling with uncertainties and difficulties as they do so. It has therefore become essential to understand how urban spatial structure changes, particularly with the increasingly available sources of ‘big data’. However, most studies mainly focus on delineating the spatial structure and its variations. Only a few have investigated the incentives behind the movement dynamics. To identify the urban structure of Greater London and uncover how it co-evolves with socio-economic and spatial policy factors, this study applies network community detection, using smart card data derived from the years 2013, 2015 and 2017, respectively. Our findings show that, firstly, between 2013 and 2017, London's urban structure moved towards a more polycentric and compact pattern. Secondly, it is found that Greater London can be clustered into five communities based on the characteristics of passengers' travel patterns. Thirdly, the dynamics of structural change in different urban clusters differ both in terms of changing intensity and potential motivation. In addition to spatial impact and spatial strategic policies, our results show that employment density and residential densities are also the main indicators that affected the interaction between Londoners in different areas on various levels. © 2021},

	abstract = {Moving along with daily life, urban residents and commuters create characteristic spatiotemporal patterns which vary extensively with the time of day. These patterns are formed via traffic flows: accordingly, understanding the impact of transportation system is essential for urban planners to evaluate expected urban activities. To explore them, we examine specifically population distributions in Seoul City by analyzing hourly population data based on mobile phone location records in combination with a couple of indicators of the Seoul Subway system. Through clustering and principal component analyses, we first demonstrate that the spatial distribution of the population is categorized according to the time of day, i.e., night, daytime, and evening, variations across which reflect the morphology of land use. We then examine the influence of the subway system on the population, employing ridership and accessibility as indicators. Our linear regression analysis shows that both are associated with the daytime and the evening populations, which implies that only commercial activities are substantially coupled to the subway system. Further, we find that the distinctive difference of night population is encoded in the probability distributions; this is elucidated by means of a multiplicative growth model for the morphological evolution of Seoul, revealing decentralization of residential areas and centralization of commercial areas. This study sheds light on the interplay of a public transportation system and land use, which is of relevance to planners and policymakers wishing to develop neighborhoods in support of sustainable modes. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As the number of bike share programs across the world has grown, studies of bike programs and operations have proliferated. Most empirical studies of bike share demand have included analyses of station use while a limited number of studies have investigated member behavior. Moreover, a limitation of this research is that the most research designs have been cross-sectional and therefore unable to establish causality. To address this limitation, we employ a quasi-experimental, difference-in-difference modeling approach using a six-year panel data set of members’ bike share trips from 2010 to 2015 in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. This research design takes advantage of changes in the bike share network over time to establish treatment and control groups and test the significance of effects of changes in accessibility on the frequency of individual member's use of bike share. Improvements in accessibility are measured as a reduction in distance to stations resulting from placement of new stations or relocation of old stations. We find a significant negative impact of distance on the frequency of use and that the effects of increasing bike share accessibility are larger in areas with denser bike share services. Specifically, members for whom access improved (i.e., distance decreased) were significantly more likely to increase the frequency of use than members for whom access remained the same. Moreover, by developing different models, we show the effects of distance are heterogeneous and vary with different built environment contexts. Members who live in areas with higher population density and a higher percentage of retail land use tended to increase their bike share use more. Our results indicate that improvements in physical accessibility may not result in practically meaningful changes in the frequency of use in all cases and imply that multi-faceted strategies for increasing use may be needed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the effect of job accessibility on residential choice and segregation of ethnic minorities and its relevance to spatial mismatch across different minority groups has not been fully captured, especially in high-density, transit-oriented cities. This study seeks to address these knowledge gaps by investigating the residential segregation of ethnic minorities in relation to job accessibility in Hong Kong. Using a suite of statistical analyses, spatial patterns of residential segregation were found to relate to disparities in the socio-economic status of different minority groups. Furthermore, modelling results suggest a significant trade-off between neighbourhood quality and job accessibility particularly for the retail and service industries of South/Southeast Asian groups. By contrast, more privileged minority groups, such as White and Japanese communities, were found to cluster predominantly in higher income neighbourhoods with improved amenities rather than living closer to employment opportunities. These insights contribute to a more nuanced understanding of spatial mismatch across different ethnic minority groups, with which we have proposed policy recommendations with a view towards improving job accessibility, particularly for lower income minority groups and have identified avenues for future research. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

However, the latter two contributions entail tradeoffs that are little-discussed in empirical research. We elaborate upon the manner in which job access affects economic and social sustainability and focus on tradeoffs between the two. We measure and characterize the impact of job access on housing prices and the spatial distribution of disadvantaged populations across New York City, using census data. Results document not only that there are significant positive effects of job access on housing but also that higher housing prices screen out disadvantaged populations and undermine social equity. Findings highlight the paradox in sustainable development that job access seldom exhibits simultaneous positive effects on economic and social equity. We propose that urban built environment might have sigificantimpact on and might be a solution to the tension between economic benefits and social loss regarding job accessibility. That is, appropriate spatial land use planning and public policies could maximize individual welfare and sustainability for future cities-a new perspective of achieving urban sustainability. The major challenge is finding a workable balance between economic and social sustainability that is theoretically sound and empirically feasible. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Daily accessibility as one of the measures of transport accessibility is an indicator that can be used, i.a. as relations between a given area’s transport system and spatial planning are analysed. The indicator provides a broad field for assessing the effectiveness of the transport system and spatial planning operating at a given time, while simultaneously indicating directions by which these may be improved. The main aim of the work detailed here was to assess whether and to what extent the current road system, as well as the layout of railway lines and connections, creates positive conditions for the development of the network configuration of Polish metropolises. In terms of application, the aim is to assess the level of implementation of the polycentric metropolitan network referred to in the KPZK 2030 document (i.e. Poland’s National Spatial Planning Concept through to the year 2030). The paper thus presents an attempt to determine the potential for mutual functional and spatial connections to be established or reinforced within Poland’s system of voivode-ship cities. That estimation of potential was based on analysis of daily (i.e. within-the-day) accessibility among the cities in question. The measurement of daily accessibility was based on the time of individual (car) travel or that involving rail transport. The analysis further included three variants for travel within the space of a given day (i.e. with 4, 6 or 8 hours available at the destination). This allowed for the development of a synthetic index of daily accessibility by which to characterise selected voivodship cities, which might then be classified in terms of their potential for establishing functional and spatial interrelatedness. The results of the research conducted offer a broad insight into the potential for selected voivodship cities to benefit from participation in the inter-agglomeration network. More-over, thanks to our research, it was possible to identify peripheral areas (in which development potential was relatively lower) – which therefore require the kind of additional activation and compensatory action foreseen by KPZK 2030. Such actions should certainly relate to improved transport accessibility among the system’s largest centres. © 2020, Polska Akademia Nauk. All rights reserved.},

In this light, it is essential to ensure good accessibility to the city from the port (and vice versa) and to ensure that urban routes within the areas close to the port offer visitors a pleasant experience, in terms of walkability and opportunities. In this paper a Walkability Comprehensive Index to evaluate the quality of facilities in proximity to port areas will be presented; the index will include evaluation concerning the accessibility of the facilities, their Level of Service and the Places of Interests for visitors entering the city from the port. The calculation of the index is based on a spatial analysis with data obtained through field surveys and by an open source approach. The methodology is applied to the case study of the Port of Catania, a coastal city located in the south of Italy. The comprehensive index provides with information on each arc of the road network, offering an aid for decision-makers in prioritizing intervention for the improvement of non-motorized infrastructure within the interface area between the port and the city. © 2020 WITPress.

	abstract = {Even though the online channel is generally not bounded by space, much insight can be derived from examining the variation in online patronage across retail space. In this paper, we propose the use of a Bayesian approach utilising the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) within its framework to estimate the risk ratios as well as probabilities of online patronage. To this end, we used publicly available data (such as household access to broadband connection, population figures and business location data) in combination with online transaction data from a focal retailer to estimate and identify which locations (i.e., postcodes) have the highest probabilities of patronage from online customers of the retailer. The three covariates adjusted for were presence of a competitor, average income at the postcode level and internet access at the postcode level; of these, internet access was found to be the most significant influencing factor on online patronage of the retailer. Overall, the resultant spatial maps provide useful predictions of how the estimated risk ratios and exceedance probabilities vary across the geographic market and the implication on opening a new offline outlet and targeting customers are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The considered multi-objective model aims to minimize the total transportation cost of a p-hub median protection model while maximizing the flow between each pair node and minimizing the total transportation time. Additionally, it considers the potential disruption risks in the hub links of the transportation network for which a failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) method is used to measure the risk of network's arcs. Consequently, the demand is assumed to be dependent on the utility proposed by each hub. Thus, the demand elasticity is considered in this paper. As the exact values of some parameters are not known in advance, a fuzzy multi-objective decision making-based approach is proposed to optimally solve small-sized problems. Furthermore, a number of sensitivity analyses are done on a real case study in the Iranian Road Transportation Sector with useful managerial insights. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Transit goals have typically focused on commuter trips but facilitating urban last mile freight logistics is a potential strategy to increase transit ridership and mitigate the demands of parcel distribution on the transportation network. Presently, most parcel lockers operate out of private businesses, but consumer surveys have found that transit users may be interested in locker facilities at transit facilities. The implementation of an unmanned, secure, common carrier parcel locker system could have benefits for non-transit users as well. This research presents a multiple-criteria approach for analyzing the potential of public transportation facilities as hosts for a common carrier locker system. Several accessibility and equity metrics, including ridership, mode of transportation, spatial distribution, and sociodemographic profiles of coverage areas are utilized. A case study utilizing real-word data from the Portland, OR region and its transit facilities is used to illustrate accessibility and equity tradeoffs. The results demonstrate that multiple facility types have the potential to host a locker system but there are complex accessibility and equity tradeoffs to be considered by stakeholders and policy makers when prioritizing locations. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.},

	abstract = {Public bicycles have been touted as a convenient, environmentally friendly, and sustainable travel mode. Public bicycles have also been viewed as one part of a holistic solution to reducing negative transportation externalities. However, government and private entities need a better understanding of factors influencing user adoption of public bicycle systems. In this survey study, 470 prospective public bicycle users from Beijing, China completed face-to-face and web-based surveys, providing their perceptions of public bicycle system attributes, perceived risk associated with public bicycle use, and their intention to switch to public bicycles as a new mode of transportation. Our findings suggest that switching intention is directly influenced by user perceptions of the risk of public bicycle use, as well as user perceptions of the system's relative advantage over other modes of transportation and perceived compatibility of public bicycles with the user's current travel habits. Moreover, perceptions of risk are found to mediate the relationship between system attributes (complexity and observability) and switching intention. That is, user perceptions that public bicycles are difficult to access and use increases perceived risk and reduces the likelihood they will switch to public bicycles as a mode of transportation. Moreover, when prospective users can observe others using the system, their perceptions of risk decrease, which increases the likelihood they will adopt public bicycles as a new mode of transportation. This research contributes to theory-building in public bicycle adoption and informs business and government leaders on how to promote public bicycle adoption through an increased focus on important public bicycle system attributes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The sustainable design of public transport services is a crucial issue that may affect the economy of local areas and the social inclusion of their inhabitants. Indeed, transport accessibility of households, businesses, and retail activities is one of the main drivers that influence location choices and sustainable development and where the public transport services may play a key (positive) role. Furthermore, the economic crisis of the 2009 and the current ones caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has further limited the funds available for public services, including the transport sector. In this critical context, sound design of public transport services assumes great importance, especially in light of financial constraints. Starting from these considerations, the aim of this paper has been to propose an innovative methodology for designing public transport services based on a rational decision-making process with stakeholder engagement, aiming to perform a sustainable development perspective. The proposed methodology combines technical aspects, social and political issues, equity perspectives, and it is aimed in obtaining a design solution that can be accepted by the whole community. The proposed theoretical design methodology has also been applied to a case study in order to verify its applicability to a real context, consisting of the design of the public transport plan of the province of Foggia in southern Italy. Applications results show that the sustainable design scenario is not only the best ones from a technical point of view, but also participated, equitable, and approved by both policymakers and stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors.},

One missing element in the knowledge base is how relative accessibility can be effectively mapped for decision-making. To fill the research gap, this paper evaluates whether cartograms are an appropriate tool for mapping relative accessibility, taking the city of Zaragoza, Spain as a case study. The research design included three phases: (i) elaboration of grid-based maps on relative non-motorized accessibility; (ii) elaboration of cartograms on relative non-motorized accessibility; (iii) an end-user evaluation with 30 local practitioners to analyze the effectiveness of cartograms to map relative accessibility compared to grid-based maps. Participants signaled that diffusion-based cartograms could be complementary to grid-based maps, providing better visualization of spatial dissimilarity patterns of accessibility between population groups. However, participants noted greater difficulty in identifying Dorling cartograms as an effective technique for mapping relative accessibility. The paper closes with a review of the strengths and weaknesses of the potential application of these visualization techniques in the field of accessibility planning. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The study aims to explore how concept stores (theoretically) differ from other experience-based retail formats, and hence, how they (practically) contribute to a diversified retail store portfolio. Design/methodology/approach: Case study based on semi-structured, qualitative interviews with seven IKEA retail managers, three industry experts and 26 customers of IKEA concept stores in London and Stockholm. Findings: The concept store represents a conceptual departure from other experiential store formats. It is neither fully experiential in the sense that it is not only about marketing communications nor is it sales or profit-focused. Its aim is to be an accessible touchpoint that reduces friction on a diversified customer journey with its value to the retail portfolio being that it attracts new and latent customers, mitigates existing inhibiting factors and drives them to other touchpoints. Research limitations/implications: Ideas about the different characteristics of new store formats and their potential to shape the customer experience are extended. New formats reflect innovation in retailing and are part of a retail portfolio which generates different customer expectations and determinants from traditional store formats which provide the customers' existing reference point. Practical implications: The contributions of new formats should be evaluated in light of other existing formats in the portfolio and not isolated. This is particularly true when considering format cannibalisation and the potentially extended customer journey that arises when customers use traditional format stores and new concept format stores simultaneously. Originality/value: Previous research, using sales metrics and market-based results as performance determinants, suggests negative outcomes for format diversification. Our study suggests that the contributions of the concept store format should be viewed from an overall customer journey perspective and the “performance” of different format based touchpoints are not best captured through traditional sales evaluation methods. © 2021, Carys Jane Egan-Wyer, Steve Burt, Jens Hultman, Ulf Johansson, Alice Beckman and Clara Michélsen.},

	abstract = {The attractiveness of a region can be measured by the social welfare functions within the framework of spatial economics. Long-run sustainable regional growth requires the attractiveness of a region to keep the centripetal forces of the local population and economic activity. This paper focuses on regions where spatial exclusion, caused by the organization of a transportation network, has already been observed. While the relevant studies on this subject separately investigate the economic behavior of households, firms, and the local government, this paper attempts to integrate them into a single framework as a unit of the regional economic agent to reveal the mutual relationships. The integrated framework applies the notion of the spatial social welfare function, including accessibility or the concepts of supply and the market areas of goods and services that should vary with the order of urban hierarchy. This paper also studies alternative spatial formation as a widely cooperative regional affiliation that can be useful for countries where the total national population and the extent of economic growth are constantly diminishing. Finally, the analysis investigates how to coordinate widely cooperative regional affiliations, and explores possibilities for adapting this specific framework for regional economic development. © 2018, Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International.

	abstract = {Pedestrian accessibility has been growing in importance as an urban planning objective. Assessing it with gravity-based or potential accessibility measures requires the selection of an impedance function in order to reflect the friction of distance. The choice of impedance function is crucial to pedestrian accessibility assessment due to the level of spatial data detail required and also because perceived distances differ from physical distances. Here, we measure and compare 20 gravity-based measures, varying the impedance function and associated parameters. Correlation analysis revealed a significant and strong correlation between the measures. Factor analysis extracted two groups of measures, differing mainly in their maximum cutoff travel distance, i.e. the distance at which the impedance function reaches zero. Spatial analysis revealed that all measures produce similar spatial results in terms of identifying high and low accessibility locations but different values for medium accessibility locations. Places located at between 200 and 400 m from an opportunity are especially sensitive to the impedance function used. We promote a cumulative–Gaussian approach to measure pedestrian accessibility, as it explicitly includes the travel tolerance concept and we found it to be the most robust measure in terms of data variability. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

This paper addresses the problem by analyzing synoptic indexes of the controlled access highway network. Recent road building in the Pittsburgh MSA has intensified network infrastructure, but efficiency has diminished. The Pittsburgh MSA is the case study because, as an aging one, it exemplifies issues facing other American cities. The analysis uses direct connectivity, gamma (γ), and characteristic path length (CPL) indexes calculated over a 30 year period. The progressively less efficient network for each decade implies that some combination of the political process, land use inertia, and financial limitations preclude consideration of urban structure in decisions about construction priorities.

A new urban park could attract more visitors and lead to neighborhood revitalization, especially in distressed neighborhoods. In order to explore this mechanism, this study analyzes the case of the Gyeongui Line Forest Park, a previously underutilized railroad that was converted to a linear urban park. A difference-in-difference approach was applied to evaluate the change in the sales of local businesses before and after the park's opening using credit card and cash sales data provided by the Seoul Metropolitan Government's Big Data Campus. The results showed that urban linear parks could have positive effects that lead to the neighborhoods’ economic vitality. However, the economic impacts could vary depending on neighborhood contexts. Specifically, economically distressed neighborhoods could benefit more from the opening of a park.

The authors seek to identify elements foundational to shopper behaviour, using insights from the extant literature. A path-to-purchase framework is proposed, and tested. The framework is further explored as a method for improving shopper segmentation. Design/methodology/approachOver 308 articles associated with the shopper are examined using a bibliometric methodology. The literature review provides the foundation for a path-to-purchase (PtP) framework. An experimental design online study is undertaken to validate the framework. Structural equation modelling is used to analyse the data. Moderation testing of importance in the model is explored. FindingsThe findings reveal five stages through which shoppers’ progress in pursuit of purchase resolution. The exploratory study reveals the positive influence of each stage one on another. Additionally, shopper perception of the importance of the recipient and the occasion moderate relationships associated with purchase outcomes. Research limitations/implicationsThe research may be limited by the selection of literature assembled from over 60 years of research, and the online methodology. Practical implicationsThe framework is suited for both industry and academia to better address shopper needs. The framework is specific to shopper behaviour relieving some of the conflicting messages which result from the overlay of consumer behaviour on a shopper. The framework describes the processes in purchase pursuit allowing brands and retailers to better support the shopper. Importance as a moderator is explored allowing for new and perhaps better ways to segment shoppers. Originality/valueThis theory building research provides a comprehensive exploration of the shopping literature to propose a PtP framework. The framework provides academicians and practitioners a more detailed method for examining and segmenting shoppers.

As measure of the relative nearness or proximity of one place and persons to all other places or persons, conceptually linked to Newton’s law of gravity, its origins can be traced back to the 1920s when it was used in location theory and regional economic planning (Batty, 2009) and retail planning (Stewart, 1948). In his classic paper, Hansen (1959) was the first to define accessibility as a potential of opportunities for interaction and applied the concept to forecast employment developments in Washington D.C.},

Situated between seaports to the north and northwest and the rest of the peninsula, and straddling the main communication route between Portugal and the rest of Europe, the region’s geographical location has led to the consolidation of a dense network of high capacity routes that endow it with strong connectivity and facilitate logistics activities. Since 2006, the Castile and Leon Regional Government has applied a logistics activity management model called CyLog, which is based on 15 hubs and five major road corridors. In this article, we analyse the efficiency of the CyLog model, the characteristics of the hubs and their location in relation to the network of high capacity corridors, ports and the region’s most important neighbouring market, Madrid,in order to determine its importance for regional development and integration. To this end, we propose and apply a methodology for measuring the accessibility of the logistics hubs that comprise CyLog. © 2015, Universidad de Granada. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Accessibility improvement for pedestrians has received increasing attention in planning. However, pedestrian space is more likely to be designed only for individual streets to secure minimum easiness of walking, and little attention has been paid to developing a street network for pedestrians to walk around multiple destinations on a neighbourhood scale. There is also a lack of empirical analysis of how much pedestrian accessibility would vary depending on the characteristics of streets on routes to specific destinations. This paper is aimed at examining the spatial relationship between pedestrian flows by street type and various street characteristics around multiple destinations in a city centre. First, a literature review summarises what street characteristics should be considered in accessibility analysis for pedestrians. Then, a pedestrian flow model is developed in a way that measures accessibility with street characteristics of origins, destinations, and routes on multi-scales from on-street ones to neighbourhood-scale ones. A multiple regression model is made using data from the West End area in London, in which street characteristics are taken for routes from each street segment to nearby stations and attractions. As a result, this analysis found that the route characteristics to a single nearest station and attraction can account for pedestrian flows well, but route characteristics to multiple nearby stations and attractions do not improve the model fit. These results are more prominent for pedestrianised streets. Their implication may be that these destinations are currently not linked well for pedestrians, and pedestrianisation is required to contribute more to the linkage. © 2015 The Author.},

This paper examines how the key concepts of PPAs and ASs have evolved, how they have been applied, what issues need to be resolved, and potential areas for future research. The review begins with the main theoretical developments influencing the applied use of these methods, and continues with a categorization of the literature across three dimensions — research domain, methods of calculation and application purpose. We find that the methods have been used not only in the core originating fields of travel behaviour and transport geography, but also in health, criminology and demography, and are growing fastest in health. The methods have been applied to a number of purposes with applications to accessibility the most common and the fastest growing. Demonstrated interest in these methods, along with the technologies and data to facilitate them, suggests a bright future for the use of PPAs and ASs in the social sciences. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

Sustainable transportation options such as green public buses, subways and public cycling have been introduced to improve environmental quality. However, their adoption is still in the initial stage. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the consumer attitude towards sustainable transportation, and their willingness to choose different environmentally friendly options like cycling and public green transportation by applying a norm activation model (NAM). More specifically, this study explored the role of different predictors (sustainable transport benefits awareness, traffic problem awareness, government policies and symbolic motives of using a car) affecting citizen's acceptability to sustainable transportation options with mediating role of environmental concern and moderating role of self-transcendence and self-enhancement. A questionnaire-based survey conducted in four major metropolitan cities of China including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Xi'an found that acceptability towards sustainable transportation is derived from sustainable transport benefits awareness and traffic. Symbolic motives of the car have a negative association with acceptability towards sustainable transportation. The mediating effect of environmental concerns was proved, which extends the role of NAM in this study. Self-transcendence and self-enhancement have positive and negative moderating effects consecutively towards the acceptability of sustainable transportation. This study has potential implications for the government of China, transportation, and urban planning departments in order to take necessary measures to promote sustainable transportation behavior in Chinese citizens. © 2018 by the authors.},

The first study shows that individuals are calibrated in terms of their health goals. Specifically, when they are far away from their ideal weight, they want to eat healthier and exercise. However, their health goals are not calibrated appropriately in the presence of regulatory incongruence of individual regulatory orientation and promotion type. Specifically, prevention-oriented individuals do not report the appropriate outcome expectation of the goal pursuit; instead, the present study finds that they do not want to increase exercise even when they are far from their health goal.

The findings of our analyses yield support for our assumption that our methodology, taking into account the relationship between households and the different retail brands they patronize, provides a broader understanding of the antecedents of households’ multiple store patronage strategies, leading eventually to a new form of customer segmentation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

Development of these fixed links may transform the outlying island communities’ current ways of life. Ferry operators struggle to maintain efficient operation, fleet investments, improved services, and attract passengers while competing with fixed link transport modes.

	abstract = {Fast-food outlets play a significant role in the nutrition of British children who get more food from such shops than the school canteen. To reduce young people’s access to fast-food meals during the school day, many British cities are implementing zoning policies. For instance, cities can create buffers around schools, and some have used 200 meters buffers while others used 400 meters. But how close is too close? Using the road network is needed to precisely computing the distance between fast-food outlets (for policies limiting the concentration), or fast-food outlets and the closest school (for policies using buffers). This estimates how much of the fast-food landscape could be affected by a policy, and complementary analyses of food utilization can later translate the estimate into changes on childhood nutrition and obesity. Network analyses of retail and urban forms are typically limited to the scale of a city. However, to design national zoning policies, we need to perform this analysis at a national scale. Our study is the first to perform a nation-wide analysis, by linking large datasets (e.g., all roads, fast-food outlets and schools) and performing the analysis over a high performance computing cluster. We found a strong spatial clustering of fast-food outlets (with 80% of outlets being within 120 of another outlet), but much less clustering for schools. Results depend on whether we use the road network on the Euclidean distance (i.e. ‘as the crow flies’): for instance, half of the fast-food outlets are found within 240 m of a school using an Euclidean distance, but only one-third at the same distance with the road network. Our findings are consistent across levels of deprivation, which is important to set equitable national policies. In line with previous studies (at the city scale rather than national scale), we also examined the relation between centrality and outlets, as a potential target for policies, but we found no correlation when using closeness or betweenness centrality with either the Spearman or Pearson correlation methods. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Investment in transport infrastructure is the main factor responsible for decreasing origin-destination travel times, which are then implemented into a potential accessibility measure. This measure uses population size as a proxy for a destination’s attractiveness. Thus, changes in population distribution as well as the development of the transport infrastructure are mutually responsible for changes in accessibility. The potential accessibility measure is applied to assess change in accessibility in Poland over a twenty year period of time (1995–2015). During this time Poland has experienced a significant change in population distribution. At the same time, accession to the European Union provided an opportunity to use the structural funds and has resulted in an unprecedented development of the transport infrastructure, in particular the road network. The coexistence of both phenomena provides perfect conditions to investigate the complex interrelationship of both components of accessibility, namely transport and land-use. This leads towards a change in the level of accessibility and its spatial pattern, resulting in a transformation of the level of territorial cohesion. However, the selection of the particular impedance parameters greatly influences the importance assigned to an element of infrastructure or a component of population accessibility. Thus, several impedance functions are applied in order to capture their influence on the balance between the infrastructure and population components of accessibility change. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the past two decades urban time policies have been proposed and implemented in many European cities as a complement to traditional spatial planning methods. Such policies seek to provide an answer to the growing number of people facing time problems as a result of an erosion of collective time rhythms and a desynchronisation of different time structures of urban life. Particular emphasis is being placed on the reconciliation of opening hours of public service facilities with the travel and activity patterns of citizens in order to increase individual accessibility to urban services. In spite of the increasing relevance of time policies, only limited quantitative research has been conducted about the relationships between opening hours and accessibility. This paper seeks to extend this line of inquiry by exploring if and to what extent the accessibility of public facilities can be ameliorated by redesigning the timetables of service delivery. A method is proposed to optimise the temporal regime of public service delivery in terms of accessibility. The method is illustrated in a case study of accessibility of government offices within the city of Ghent (Belgium). Our findings suggest that by rescheduling the opening hours of public service facilities individual accessibility to service delivery can be improved significantly. Our study may support urban service deliverers, policymakers and urban planners in assessing timetables for a better 'accessible' service provision. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Drawing on job-autonomy and self-determination theories, we contend that initiatives that limit managerial discretion in hiring and promotion—job tests, performance evaluations, and grievance procedures—will elicit resistance and produce adverse effects. Drawing on transparency and accountability theories, we contend that bureaucratic reforms that increase transparency for job-seekers and hiring managers—job postings and job ladders—will have positive effects. Finally, drawing on accountability theory, we contend that monitoring by diversity managers and federal regulators will improve the effects of bureaucratic reforms. We examine the effects of personnel innovations on managerial diversity in 816 U.S. workplaces over 30 years. Our findings help explain the nation’s slow progress in reducing job segregation and inequality. Some popular bureaucratic reforms thought to quell discrimination instead activate it.

We discuss the modelling of urban green space walkability by utilising web-based Geographical Information System (web-GIS) to calculate eco-friendly walk scores based on the presence of green spaces by integrating Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) data and other GIS datasets.

Yet comparatively little is known about how factors related to distance may affect peri-urban national park use, particularly outside the United States of America. This paper reports on research investigating distance-related factors affecting use of a peri-urban national park in Brisbane, Australia. This study found that older visitors live closer to the park while younger visitors travel further to use it. Surprisingly, travel distance did not vary with the type of recreational activities that users were conducting in the park. These results have implications for park planning and management including user demand for different recreational activities in peri-urban national parks. Results are useful for scholars using distance decay models to explain travel behaviour, evidencing the empirical veracity of the model in different places and across different service types. The findings are especially important for geographers because they demonstrate that assumptions about uniform park catchments may be unsupported and need to be empirically validated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

First, the main decision parameters of the interplay between road pricing and public transport are reviewed and appropriate methodological approaches are identified. A set of policies which aim at improving urban public transport ridership and reducing private vehicle use, are considered on the basis of a flexible consumer demand system and evaluated through simulation experiments. The experiments focus on the hypothetical implementation of a national distance-based road charging policy package in Greece. The simulation results indicate that a suitably designed policy package can significantly enhance modal split in favor of public transport without significantly increasing the level of road user charges. To be more specific, for a nation-wide scheme, a combination of an optimal vehicle-km charge (in terms of the optimal fuel price index share required to achieve the desired urban public transport expenditure share) with a half-fare policy results in a considerable reduction of the private vehicle expenditure share, but with a much lower level of road user charge. For the highly urbanized region of Attica, the imposition of the optimal vehicle-km charge per se (without affecting urban transit fares) can provide the largest benefits, in terms of considerably reducing private vehicle share and attaining the target level of urban public transport share. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

The literature on environmental equity focuses especially on the distribution of nuisances and resources, which, because of the unequal spatial distribution of different social groups, leads to an increased exposure to risks or to less access to beneficial elements for certain populations. Little work has been done on the multidimensionality of different environmental burdens and the lack of resources in some urban environments. This article has two main objectives. The first objective is to construct an environmental equity index that takes into consideration seven components of the urban environment (traffic-related pollutants, proximity to major roads and highways, vegetation, access to parks, access to supermarkets, and the urban heat island effect). The second objective is to determine whether groups vulnerable to different nuisances—namely, individuals under fifteen years old and the elderly—and those who tend to be located in the most problematic areas according to the environmental justice literature (i.e., visible minorities and low-income populations) are affected by environmental inequities associated with the application of the composite index at the city block level. The results obtained by using four statistical techniques show that, on the Island of Montreal, low-income persons and, to a lesser extent, visible minorities are more frequently located in city blocks close to major roads and with higher concentrations of NO2 and less vegetation. Finally, the environmental equity index is significantly lower in areas with high concentrations of low-income populations in comparison with the wealthiest areas. © 2016 by American Association of Geographers.},

	abstract = {Although the concept of social equity seems to be ubiquitous in most mobility plans of major Latin American cities, when evaluating transport projects for financing and prioritisation there are no specific or solid indicators to measure how they can contribute to promoting better access to opportunities, particularly for the most vulnerable segments of the population. In response, we designed a methodology that uses the concepts of accessibility and affordability as a complementary means for evaluating public transport investment, and identifying transport disadvantages and priorities for project generation. This is based on the calculation of accessibility levels to the labour market for different zones of a given city, by introducing a function of impedance composed by travel time budget and the percentage of income spent on transportation.The characteristics of time and percentage of income spent for accessing work obtained from transportation surveys define the "real accessibility" to employment for all the zones of a city. Then, a stated preference survey was applied in order to determine the desired expenditure in both variables, and the accessibility to jobs in this new situation was subsequently calculated. We calculated a third type of accessibility, using "standard" values of travel time and expenditure budget.This methodology is therefore used to evaluate different policies in Bogota, corresponding to changes in the fare structure of the existing public transport system, by proposing the development of cross subsidies, and carrying out an appraised on the impact of the development of a new Bus Rapid Transit line. The results show that depending on the population, its location and purchasing power, the impact of a redistributive fare with respect to accessibility to the labour market can be greater than the expansion and improvement of the public transport network. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {To deal with issues of equity in transport, increasing attention is being paid to addressing inequalities in accessibility. Existing approaches to measuring accessibility tend to focus on objective measurement, often using journey time as an indicator of spatial separation of people from places. However, using objective measures of spatial accessibility could obscure inequities in accessibility that occur due to differences in perceptions of accessibility among (groups of) individuals. This paper uses data from a case study in Greater Nottingham, UK, to demonstrate that there are differences between self-reported and objective measures of journey time access to destinations. Self-reported journey times to a number of destinations by walking, public transport, and car are compared with a nationally available dataset of accessibility indicators. Then, factors associated with self-reported journey times are investigated to understand what accounts for differences between indi-vidual’s self-reported understanding and objective measures of journey time accessibility. Results show that there is a difference between self-reported and objective measures, and that objective measures usually underestimate journey time accessibility. These differences occur because of demographic factors (e.g., age), trip familiarity, and destination definition. If accessibility metrics are to be used to address issues of social inequity related to transport, then there is a need to consider how diverse perceptions of accessibility relate to objective measures and to develop approaches that can account for social as well as spatial variation in accessibility. © 2018 Angela Curl.},

As an important index, the ability of urban public green landscape serving for residents is often used to measure the level of urban developing and harmonicity of human-land relation. Traditional evaluating method did not take into account the spatial distribution of green landscape. Actually, the main factors affecting public green landscape accessibility include quality of public green landscape, distribution of the urban population, actuality of urban land use, and road traffics establishment. Based on GIS, the study area is divided into many regular grids. Spatial distribution features of accessibility of public green landscape are researched by computing the accessibility in each cell. The resistance of traffic cost is simulated by computing road density in each cell and simultaneous population density distributing and area of public green landscape are also integrated into the computing method. A case study in Guangzhou city area was implemented by GIS tool-Arclnfo9 and some research results were gained by computing accessibility of public green landscape. It is concluded that the method has better practicability and calculability and provides a scientific basis for urban plan and green landscape plan.},

This paper applies discrete demand models to examine the satisfaction of citizens or frequent visitors with these schemes in two streets that are not part of the urban center of the city of Seville (Spain) and the conclusions that are drawn can be easily extrapolated to other cities, irrespective of the country that they are in. These two pedestrianizations outside the traditional inner city are clearly positively valued by citizens, especially by people living in the vicinity of the pedestrianized streets and by the collectives that have more available free time or more flexible schedules. They have also been especially welcomed by citizens who are more aware of the need for environmental protection and calling for a more a more sustainable city. The results show that both pedestrianizations have resulted in significant changes in citizens' shopping and consumption habits in establishments located in the pedestrian zones, which have been turned into open air malls with improvements to their lively ambience. These findings are repeated in countries at different levels of development. These results are in stark contrast to the strong social rejection that existed during the period that the road works to pedestrianize the zones were being planned and executed. In fact, the results show the importance of the time variable, as the more time that has passed since the works were finalized, the better the variables that measure satisfaction with the pedestrianizations have become, and the less negative the perception of the negative externalities associated with the road works. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Three factors of neighbourhood attractiveness—aesthetic, amenity, and social interaction—are identified. To map those factors, a set of surrogate measures that replace survey data derived subjective importance scores with objective measures derived from a series of GIS data overlays are developed. A factor score coefficient matrix is used to derive a set of parameterised linear equations which permits a spatial representation of the factors across the suburbs comprising the Brisbane-SEQ region. This results in a set of maps which display spatial variations in the attractiveness of suburbs vis a vis the derived dimensions of subjective attractiveness for residential selection by people. © 2006, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

	abstract = {An increasing number of metropolitan governments are proposing or have already implemented measures that have as their goal the reduction of vehicular congestion in and around their cities, and, concomitantly, the reduction of environmentally hazardous emissions. Many of these measures involve the establishment of a tolling system that charges drivers of motorised vehicles a sum of money when they pass into established zones and sometimes when they pass out of these zones. Charges are either a flat rate, as in London, or may vary according to time of day, as in Stockholm. Exemptions from paying the tolls, or reductions in the amount to be paid, are made in some cases, such as for low-emission vehicles or for public facility vehicles and for residents living inside the zones, but relief from paying the tolls is not given based on ability to pay. This is an unfair form of taxation which penalises the economically challenged citizens who must pay a higher proportion of their income to drive their vehicles, and rewards the economically advantaged with less congestion and fewer delays on the roads. This paper will explore why tolling schemes for urban congestion mitigation and emission reduction are unfair and discriminatory, and will present a case for alternative measures, especially incentives using voucher schemes, which would result in achieving similar goals while not disadvantaging certain groups of citizens.},

A troubling aspect of emissions from the transport sector is that they are increasing rapidly. With the ongoing rapid increase in population, expansion of middle class in developing countries, and availability of cheaper vehicles such as Tata Nano in India, the desire to own private vehicles is within reach now than ever for millions of people in the developing world. This could have a huge implication on ongoing effort towards containment of GHG emissions. We look at the role of urban design forms - settlement density - housing and employment activities and the effects they could have in reducing travel demands, motor vehicle dependency and GHG emissions. Although urban planning has a limited effect on the reduction of GHG emissions, in the short term, due to the time needed to build up the necessary infrastructures, in the long term, it can be very effective through the shift from private vehicle dependency to public and other alternative environmentally friendly modes of transports (such as walking and cycling). A mixture of high residential and employment density could influence shorter commuter journeys and a reduction in private vehicle use if it is supported by an efficient public transport system and appropriate fiscal and regulatory instruments. Among the set of available instruments to reduce GHGs from the transport sector, urban planning, may be equally important, if not more to contain emissions from the transport sector. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

One of the emerging fields of research is the temporal dynamics of accessibility. The increase in availability of General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data permits the inclusion of very detailed, schedule-based travel time information. In the study presented we focus on the spatial and temporal variation in accessibility by public transport in the city of Szczecin (Poland). This paper advocates the necessity of incorporating a temporal component in accessibility analysis. We conducted a full day analysis for 1 day using averaged 15-min-long time periods at a very detailed spatial scale (enumeration districts). Based on the calculated origin-destination matrix in 96 time-profiles we calculated the potential accessibility indicator. Then we investigated spatial disparities and their variability during the day-long observation. Apart from the well-known spatial disparities in accessibility level, our findings underline the uncertainty of the accessibility pattern. Moreover, the results show that less accessible areas are also more affected by the daily variation in accessibility level. The findings provide a more realistic insight into accessibility patterns which will be useful for transport planners and policy makers. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

This paper aims to quantify the gap in accessing affordable health care facilities faced by the socio-economically weaker sections of society. Majority of the older cities in India have a central core and surrounding peri-urban areas, which were added later on to minimize the stress of urban expansion and to provide adequate infrastructure. This research states that installation of new facilities for catering to the growing needs of citizens in expanding cities is the need of the hour. We propose a novel technique for maximizing the health care coverage of the peri-urban areas by establishing the minimum number of new public health care facilities. Our aim is to suggest strategies for efficient implementation of policies such as the National Urban Health Mission and the National Health Policy. We considered Kolkata Municipal Corporation, India as a case study to assess our proposed methodology. The southern periphery, which was added in 1981 and has currently expanded again in 2015, is completely devoid of public health care facilities. Our optimization model showed that 13 new public facilities are required in the southern periphery, out of which five are extremely critical. The rise in health care coverage from 76.19 to 90.05 % by taking only the southern periphery into consideration shows the impact of the new facilities placed according to the proposed framework. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Recent research on factors influencing park accessibility, equity and efficiency of park use has received increasing attention. These factors are mainly determined by the maximum distance to urban parks and associated park-based and user-based factors. Variations of recreational services caused by the spatial relationship between urban parks and residences are almost ignored. This paper investigates how recreational services decay from urban parks to residences and how this spatial decay is affected by factors relating to the service delivery. In this context, spatial decay means that the radiation strength of park services decline in dependancy of the spatial organization of the surrounding urban space. The results of this study highlight that the spatial distribution and distance as well as factors such as park space, the availability of other services, transport facilities and preferences, and age and gender of park visitors are related to the recreational services of urban parks. Our findings suggest that the quantification of spatial decays and the identification of relevant factors can help to avoid unfavorable spatial distributions of parks, so that an equitable and efficient park system can be achieved for all urban residents. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

How do people use their social connections to get jobs? How did large bureaucratic organizations come to be so pervasive in modern economies-and what difference does it make? How can we explain the persistence of economic inequalities between men and women and across racial groups? Why do some countries become rich while others stay poor?

It is concluded that, although vehicle and fuel taxation measures vary between jurisdictions, ultimately policy-makers should consider calibrating vehicle and fuel taxation to ensure that externalities are internalised, costs are shifted from vehicle ownership to use and that marginal variable costs are transparent to the network user. However, it is possible that achieving ETR through full internalisation of external costs could be contentious due to political concerns over the potental impact on lower socio-economic groups and rural communities as well as commercial concerns over the competitiveness of the freight sector and macroeconomic impacts. © 2014, IGI Global.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this research is to develop a methodology for calculating the index of the spatial equity for the public transportation services for the city of Seoul using the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient based on accessibility to the services. The index was estimated for 100 m × 100 m cells first and then aggregated for 424 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in the city. The indices for Seoul’s subway and bus were represented with and without the weighting factor. On the basis of this methodology, this study assessed the effect of an additional subway line on the spatial equity before and after its operation. Furthermore, an index of relative difference indicating the change in population and employment in the station areas was applied to investigate the changed effects of spatial equity between population and employment from the new subway line. The core findings from this research are summarized as follows. First, the subway network of Seoul provides more unequal public transportation services for the TAZs than for the bus network. Second, an improvement in the operation frequency of both transit modes would deepen the spatial inequity of Seoul. Third, a subway extension plan for Seoul could noticeably reduce the spatial inequity. The plan would improve the spatial equity for the population more than that for employment. The most important meaning of this study is to be found in combining spatial equity on the supply side with transit-oriented development (TOD) on the demand side. So, by establishing a TOD policy for the additional subway station areas, an appropriate land-use pattern can be established for maximizing potential ridership in consideration of the combination. © 2016 The Institute of Urban Sciences.},

This paper examines the issue of siting hurricane disaster relief facilities based on equity vs. efficiency objectives, in light of populations’ socioeconomic differences. Population differences are measured in terms of a household income variable. p-median and vertex p-center problems are applied to find relief center locations in a Southeastern U.S. city.

It identifies multiple drivers for the recent re-engagement with transport, suggesting that the way in which transport has become enmeshed with other forms of flow and circulation across multiple spatial and temporal scales may be the most significant. It reviews recent geographical research on the enmeshment of transport and a wide range of other circulations in three settings: the economy, climate change, and public health. The review suggests that the now widespread attention to transport issues by geographers who may not self-identify as experts in transport or mobilities is the defining characteristic of recent work on the geographies of transport. The re-engagement from across the discipline is potentially reinventing the field by bringing an unprecedented variety of perspectives to bear on the geographical analysis of transport. It means that the transport geography community should not limit its attention to staging further dialogue with the mobilities community but rather strike up more topic-oriented conversations across the whole discipline. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

This research focuses on two cities that institutionalized citizen participation in their transit planning processes. In Detroit, Michigan a Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) was established to assist with the preparation of a regional transit master plan while the City of Hamilton in Ontario formed a Citizens' Jury (CJ) to examine the establishment of light rail transit. The article analyzes these mechanisms' overall representativeness of the general population, their operation and contribution to 'policy learning', and their impact on subsequent transit policies. We find that these participatory mechanisms are generally regarded as important and useful by both the participants and the politicians that established them. In spite of this, the conclusion reached is that neither mechanism had a significant impact on transit policies. In both cases, the policy decisions were affected by a range of factors and particularly the local and regional political contexts. Indeed, it can be argued that both cities are plagued with regional divides that potentially no amount of citizen participation can solve. © 2017 by the Institute of Urban Studies.},

To address these limitations, this study draws upon recent developments in space-time measures of individual accessibility to explore the spatial and temporal structures of demand by considering individuals' space-time constraints and impact of existing urban structures. Based on a time-geographic framework, eight space-time demand measures were developed and compared with three conventional location-based demand measures for 12 hospitals through an empirical study conducted in Columbus, Ohio. The results show that geographic proximity between clients' home and facilities may not be an effective indicator for service demand, and conventional demand measures tend to underestimate potential demand for service in most situations. The study concludes that space-time demand measures that take into account people's activity-travel patterns in space-time would lead to better estimation of demand for service in most cases. © 2014 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.},

	abstract = {Change is inevitable in all communities: they both grow and decline. Planning is a means by which we have sought to manage this change. It has not always succeeded in providing the types of settlements and environments which many residents and others want, either because it is operating with the wrong policies or because it is failing to ensure that the right policies are effectively implemented. These failings have opened planning to criticism by a dominant neoliberal orthodoxy which shapes an increasingly difficult environment in which planning has to operate. Planning for Small Town Change builds on an underexploited selection of international research and the authors’ English case studies to consider the efficacy of planning for change. Drawing on insightful small town experiences, three themes emerge: understanding and conceptualising change; appreciating the potential within place; and the mechanisms for planning and delivery. The research draws on many examples of how key actors have made a significant difference to specific places and provides important insights into how the planning process can be better matched to the long-term and complex challenges faced. Whilst small town experiences are often neglected, they are found to be particularly insightful in understanding the potential roles of local communities and the importance of place quality when planning for change. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

Methods: Two indicators of the socio-economic context of neighbourhood of residence based on wealth and deprivation were estimated in a sample of 727 children and adolescents residents in Madrid (Spain). Multilevel logit models were used to calculate the relationship between each indicator and obesity and physical inactivity. Results: After adjusting for household socio-economic position, obesity prevalence was 3.79 times higher among subjects living in deprived areas than among those living in non-deprived areas (CI: 1.95-7.34), and 2.38 higher among subjects living in less wealthy areas than in those living in wealthier areas (CI: 0.85-6.65). Adjustment for the availability of retail shops in subjects' neighbourhood of residence failed to change the magnitude of the association. Neither neighbourhood socio-economic context nor availability of sports facilities was related to physical inactivity. Conclusion: In the city of Madrid, socio-economic context of neighbourhood of residence shows an inverse relationship with obesity but not with physical inactivity among children. The relationship observed with obesity is not explained by the availability of area facilities. © The Author 2015.

Research mainly focuses on freight measures (pilot actions) performed in an urban context, but the local authority perspective is lacking in many aspects. The review shows some areas that local authorities need to consider when working with freight transport in the urban area, according to the literature: measures; monitoring and evaluation; performance indicators; transfer of knowledge between cities/countries; and, stakeholder involvement.},

In this study, food facilities are classified into Facility Group I where food facilities cook meals and provide customers with a space to eat meals and Facility Group II where food facilities cook meals but provide no space for eating. By comparing the transportation and initial loads, this approach models the zone where residents find that one facility is more advantageous to the others. This article also compares the loads of facilities between the case where a user makes a round trip to a facility and the case where the user stops by a facility on the way from/to his/her home. The proposed model theoretically explains the zones obtained in the preceding empirical analysis. Analysis on the locations of facilities and the population distribution around a station shows that the facilities of low initial load were located near the station to promote users to stop by, and that areas with small loads tend to have a large share of single-person households. © 2015, Architectural Institute of Japan.

	abstract = {Transit-oriented urban intensification is proposed to be the most fundamental planning approach for a sustainable city. The key notion of urban intensity remains vague referring to the integration of land-use, transport and density. Limited research at local scale, reduction to urban form and the lack of a clear conception of intensity has led to inconsistencies in the discourse of transit-orientation. The Brooklyn case study is presented as a laboratory for exploring urban intensity of this rail-based assemblage. The selected study area is mid-rise, compact mix of housing, retail, offices, industry and amenities. The analysis is based on assemblage thinking: place is conceived as a synergy of people, dwellings, functions, densities, flows and practices. It is here proposed that the three complementary Cs: concentration, connectedness and co-functioning mediate urban intensity. Concentration resonates with building heights, site coverage, dwelling densities, co-functioning with functional, formal and social mix, and connectivity with access, movement networks. Urban intensity emerges from the interaction, links and adaptations of the three Cs, and is manifested in flows of people, transport, information and goods throughout the city. This paper explores ways in which urban intensity emerges in the Brooklyn assemblage. This comprehensive multi-scalar understanding of urban intensification contributes to sustainable urban practices. © 2014 WIT Press.},

In particular, the role of public transport is likely to increase significantly, and new methods and technics to better plan transit systems are in dire need. This paper examines one fundamental aspect of transit: network centrality. By applying the notion of betweenness centrality to 28 worldwide metro systems, the main goal of this paper is to study the emergence of global trends in the evolution of centrality with network size and examine several individual systems in more detail. Betweenness was notably found to consistently become more evenly distributed with size (i.e. no "winner takes all") unlike other complex network properties. Two distinct regimes were also observed that are representative of their structure. Moreover, the share of betweenness was found to decrease in a power law with size (with exponent 1 for the average node), but the share of most central nodes decreases much slower than least central nodes (0.87 vs. 2.48). Finally the betweenness of individual stations in several systems were examined, which can be useful to locate stations where passengers can be redistributed to relieve pressure from overcrowded stations. Overall, this study offers significant insights that can help planners in their task to design the systems of tomorrow, and similar undertakings can easily be imagined to other urban infrastructure systems (e.g., electricity grid, water/wastewater system, etc.) to develop more sustainable cities. © 2012 Sybil Derrible.},

More recently, attention has turned to jobs-housing fit – the extent to which housing price is well matched to local job quality. Prior analyses have been constrained by a lack of local data on job quality, making it difficult to identify the geography and scale of the problem. We introduce a new methodology for calculating the low-wage jobs-housing fit at both a jurisdiction and neighborhood scale that was designed in collaboration with affordable housing advocates and has been directly applied in urban planning and affordable housing policy efforts. Low-wage fit is particularly important because of ongoing difficulties with affordable housing provision and the disproportionate benefits of reducing transportation costs for low-income earners. We use the calculated metric at both a city and neighborhood scale to identify what can be learned from a low-wage jobs-housing fit metric that is not evident in traditional measures of jobs-housing balance. In contrast to jobs-housing balance, the low-wage fit analysis clearly highlights those jurisdictions and neighborhoods where there is a substantial shortage of affordable housing in relation to the number of low-wage jobs. Because of the geographic coverage of the data sources used, the results can be widely applied across the United States by affordable housing advocates, land-use planners, and policy makers. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Recent years have shown a rising popularity of the concept of resilience—both theoretically and empirically—in complex systems analysis. There is also a rising literature on resilience in the transport and spatial-economic field. The pluriform interpretation of resilience (e.g., engineering vs. ecological resilience) is related to methodological differences (e.g., stability in dynamics vs. evolutionary adaptivity). But in all cases the fundamental question is whether a complex system that is subjected to an external shock is able to recover, and if so, to which extent. The present paper [Based on presentation from cluster 6 (Accessibility) of the Nectar 2015 conference in Ann Arbour, USA.] aims to add a new dimension to resilience analysis in spatial systems, by addressing in particular the relationship between spatial accessibility at a municipality level and the resilience outcomes of the spatial system concerned. It does so by investigating to which extent accessibility of Swedish and Dutch municipalities has mitigated the local shock absorption from the recent economic recession. In our study the shock absorption capacity of municipal accessibility is estimated by analysing the relevant resilience indicators for the period concerned. In this context, conventional resilience indicators based on either multivariate complex data (in particular, the Foster Resilience Capacity Index) or employment data (in particular, the Martin Resilience-Employment Index) are confronted with spatial connectivity data based on local accessibility measures, so that geographical mobility may be regarded as one of the shock-mitigating factors. The empirical analysis is carried out for two countries which have both proven to be rather shock-resistant during the recent economic crisis, viz. Sweden and The Netherlands. Clearly, the geographical structure of these countries forms a sharp mutual contrast, viz. a spatially dispersed economy with a few distinct urban concentrations versus a spatially dense economy with one major metropolitan centre (the Randstad), respectively. Our experiments are carried out for the 290 municipalities in Sweden and 40 COROPs in The Netherlands. Our research findings show relevant and new insights into differences in the local recovery potential in Sweden and The Netherlands. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Despite measurement difficulties, several studies have recognized the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a tool to promote sustainability. The aim of this paper is to design a model to measure the implementation of CSR practices in hotels in two well-known tourist regions, namely the Algarve in Portugal and the Costa del Sol in Spain. To do this, a Delphi method was applied: 16 experts from the two regions were asked to quantify the desirability of implementing 32 CSR practices in three areas: environmental, social, and economic. As a result, a three-dimensional model was constructed to provide a quantitative overview of the hotel industry's commitment to and preferences in implementing CSR practices. Despite the high level of consistency between the two groups, statistically significant differences were found in the priority assigned to four CSR practices.

	abstract = {High Speed Rail's (HSR) main objective is to attract air passengers between big metropolitan areas however the main territorial implications in many cases occur not in these metropolitan areas but in the intermediate cities. These implications open up new spatial planning possibilities such as decentralization, new regional centres and urban renewal projects. This book presents the experience of 20 years of HSR in Spain including some explicit information, arguments and conclusions derived from HSR in other European Countries. It debates the HSR territorial implications at three scales: national, regional and local, thus being of interest for strategic debates at those scales, such as the decision of new national lines, the pros and cons of deviating the line to reach minor intermediate cities or the selection of precise locations for new stations and the development projects in their surroundings. Comparisons with the recent changes in accessibility, spatial distribution of population and activities, are made with mobility for working purposes and with the characteristics of the HSR passengers. This book also examines the actions, strategies and urban projects that medium size cities can use to make best use of HSR opportunities, synthesising the experience of HSR medium cities in Spain and Europe. The book's conclusions will be of interest, over and above scholars, to transport infrastructure decision makers, city and regional planners and managers, and transport companies. © José m. de Ureña 2012.},

The research methodology uses space syntax analysis as well as statistical calculations. The spatial accessibility model is combined with commercial activity data from three different types of settlements in Cairo: The throughout planned Al-Sharekat, and the informal areas Ezbet Al-Nasr and Abu Qatada. As a contrast to Cairo's informal areas, the throughout planned Al-Sharekat area is a typical example of modern urban areas with a planned modern urban shopping centre. The results demonstrate that micro scale businesses, run and owned by low income people, are sensitive to having high degree of spatial accessibility to potential customers. This spatial feature is missing in the throughout planned Al-Sharekat. Accordingly, unplanned areas are not chaotic in terms of commercial activity patterns. Finally, superficial insights that distribute activities on the principle of abstract geometric distance, such as putting the service centre of the neighbourhood in its geographical centre should be revisited.},

Meeting mobility needs of urban dwellers is critical to sustaining growth and social stability, but many major cities struggle to do so. The evolving situation in Beijing, is examined, and the policy-making process in Beijing is analyzed to understand why transportation problems occur and are intractable and how they can be solved. A structure of policy making is proposed that includes four factors: institutional, travel behavior, ideals, and landmark events. The analysis includes a case study and comparison of transit service in Beijing and other cities, including results from the latest transit level-of-service rider survey in Beijing. It is concluded that an imbalance between transportation supply and demand is the primary cause of traffic congestion. The transportation problem must be solved from two sides: increasing supply and managing demand simultaneously. Public transit, paired with transportation demand management, is an effective approach for sustainable transportation but requires a range of policies.},

To help understand why, this study measures the importance shoppers assign to car convenience, their perceptions of shopping malls and shopping strips (also referred to as Main Street or the High Street) in relation to it, and then compares them in their actual provision of it. To achieve these objectives, the study utilised a consumer household survey and a retail audit. The results of the study indicate that consumers regard car convenience as an important determinant of where they choose to shop, and perceive malls as a superior source of it. Moreover, with the sole exception of being able to park close to desired stores, malls offer car-borne shoppers more convenient access and parking. The findings suggest that any strategy designed to deter car usage should be designed to impact equally on both mall shopping and strip shopping, or risk tipping the balance even further in favour of the mall. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The concept of walkability conveys how conducive the built environment is to walking. It has been adopted in many parts of the world to predict people's physical activity and mode of transportation (Frank and Engelke 2005; Owen et al. 2004; Sallis et al. 2004). Walkability captures the proximity between functionally complementary land uses (live, work, and play) and the directness of a route or the connectivity between destinations (Forsyth and Southworth 2008; Moudon et al. 2006). A walk score is an indicator of how friendly an area is for walking. This score is related to the benefits to society in terms of energy savings and improvements in health that a particular environment offers to its residents. For example, a recently developed walk score web site uses Google Maps, specifically Google's local search application programming interface (API), to find stores, restaurants, bars, parks, and other amenities within walking distance of any address entered. The walk score currently includes addresses in the United States of America, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The algorithm behind this score indicates the walkability of a given route based on the fixed distance from one's home to nearby amenities. The number of amenities found nearby is the leading predictor of whether people will walk rather than take another travel mode. However, evaluating walkability is challenging because it requires the consideration of many subjective factors (Reid 2008). Moreover, all technical disciplines related to walkability have their own terminology and jargon (Abley 2005). © 2012 Springer Japan. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Continued urbanisation, and the resultant increase in urban trips, presents one of the greatest challenges to the environmental, economic and social sustainability of society. Given that the modal split between transport modes has remained relatively unaltered in recent decades, this suggests that the levels of private car usage will lead to even greater levels of congestion and air pollution in urban areas. Therefore, a modal shift from private to public transport needs to be effected with urgency. However, whilst in theory this could be achieved with relative ease, numerous societal, political and economic barriers have thus far prevented such a shift from occurring. These have been analysed in detail, using a holistic approach which simultaneously considers all stakeholder needs. Recognising that traveller opinions and requirements are fundamental in effecting modal shift measures, the effects of public transport quality attributes on encouraging modal shift are discussed, accompanied by an updated version of the UK Department for Transport's hierarchy of public transport needs. This investigation then proceeds to analyse the effectiveness of methods to control urban car usage, before discussing solutions to address the barriers to a notable, successful modal shift, including guidance on how to design modal shift programmes. This paper provides useful and insightful guidance for all those involved in attempting to evoke sustainable mobility through a modal shift to public transport systems. © 2014 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have established that residents of low-income neighborhoods in major metropolitan areas have access to many more jobs by car than by transit. In this paper, we revisit this question and present evidence on how the mode of transit station access/egress (by walking, bicycling, or driving) can importantly influence the gap between car and transit accessibility in the San Diego region. We construct two accessibility measures to analyze low-wage job access by transit: (1) the number of low-wage jobs accessible within a 30-min commute and (2) the number of low-wage jobs within a 30-min commute adjusted by the number of potentially competing workers who live within 30 min. We then simulate several policy changes that could reduce the difference in transit vs car accessibility. Examples include using faster station access/egress modes such as bicycling and driving to or from transit stations and reducing transit service wait time. Our results demonstrate that in the San Diego region, if transit riders walk to/from transit stops, low-wage job accessibility by car is almost 30 times larger than low-wage job accessibility by public transit. We find that changing the mode of access and egress to and from stations is more effective at improving transit access to low-wage jobs than policies that reduce transit wait time or improve service headway. Given the transition of transportation to a “service” or “sharing” economy, these results have important implications for how to improve access to employment in low income neighborhoods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Because of the competitive market conditions, retailers severely try to find out what they should do to be preferred by potential customers, and consequently to grow their sales. In this context, the criteria influencing customers' store selection decision have to be analyzed. Although the relationship between customer preferences and retail store attributes has been widely studied through exploratory studies, a comprehensive framework using a multi-criteria decision making method under uncertainty to provide an overall assessment for retail stores has not yet been proposed. Pythagorean fuzzy sets are quite capable of representing uncertainty and vagueness in a decision making process by providing a larger domain to experts in expressing their opinions. Therefore, in this study, a novel interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy WASPAS method is developed to evaluate the performance of retail stores. The obtained results are compared with crisp WASPAS and interval-valued intuitionistic WASPAS methods and it is revealed that the proposed method provides reliable and informative outputs. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

In the case of the Lyon Metropolitan Area (France), we simulate a cordon pricing and evaluate its impacts on inequalities. We adopt a comparison-based approach to reduce the bias resulting from the spatial division. In agreement with the literature, we show that different inequality indicators produce contrasted and sometimes contradictory results, both at the scale of zones or metropolitan level. Results from Theil and Atkinson indicators point out introducing a toll can reduce inequalities in the most peripheral zones. Although we observe an accessibility improvement, particularly for central zones, the first ring (adjacent to the toll zone) is the most adversely affected by toll. © 2015, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2015.},

The results from these areas show that transit circuity exponentially declines as travel time increases. Moreover, we find that the circuity of transit networks is higher than that of road networks, illustrating how transit systems choose to expand their spatial coverage at the expense of directness and efficiency in public transportation networks.

It is often feared that closure of a local facility will negatively affect the accessibility of that service and the liveability of the village. This paper examines how villagers experience the loss of a small local supermarket. Building on the concept of sense of place, we examine how people's attitude towards place-change relates to the functional, social, symbolic and emotional meanings a supermarket can have for individuals and for a community. A survey (n = 312) was conducted shortly before the closure of the supermarket in Ulrum, a depopulating village in the rural North of the Netherlands. The results show that negative evaluation of closure can be explained by individual emotional attachment to the supermarket and by the general symbolic value of a supermarket for a village. Contradictory to popular belief, perceptions of decreasing accessibility or diminishing liveability do not exemplify why many residents react negatively to the closure of the supermarket. In the Dutch rural context, access is only an issue for a relatively small group of people consisting mostly of elderly and less mobile citizens, while large groups of villagers may react negatively to closure of rural facilities. We propose that in different international contexts people may experience senses of loss and can react negatively to facility-decline due to the social, symbolic and emotional meaning of rural facilities. © 2017 The Authors},

We apply our conceptual approach in an examination of trends in sustainable accessibility for different social groups living in Gothenburg, Sweden between 1990 and 2014. On the basis of welfare-related and time-geographical considerations, we investigate accessibility by proximity for low- and high-income earners, people with small children, and elderly people. We investigate to what extent proximity to fundamental facilities increases or decreases over time, indicating changing conditions for sustainability. The results show that opportunities for living a local life and achieving accessibility via proximity differ socially. Low-income earners and the elderly generally live closer to the facilities important for daily life than do high-income earners and parents of young children. We also show that the opportunities for various social groups to obtain access by proximity change over time. For example, we observe a trend in which over time older people face reduced opportunities to reach daily facilities in their local neighborhoods. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the development of service quality research in hospitality and tourism from 1984 to 2014, to identify research gaps and to suggest directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach: This review comprised three steps with the first being the generation of a structural map by using the online pathfinder network (PFNET) to identify potential research themes. The second research step involved an online literature search covering 2,211 academic journal articles to obtain basic information for planning an additional content investigation concerning the research themes. The final step was to investigate the content of the articles published in top-tier journals or frequently cited ones in three different stages (1984-1993, 1994-2003 and 2004-2014) to explore potential research topics. Findings: The study identifies 17 research themes that comprise two main research themes, seven sub-stems, six outer-leaves and two little-leaves. The developments of service quality research in each theme are explored. The role of each theme in service quality study is revealed. Finally, this study identifies research opportunities for service quality research within each theme. Practical implications: This study demonstrates how to use PFNET to effectively perform a systematic literature review. By referring to previous publications reviewed in this study, researchers can contribute by extending existing theories in their further research on the seventeen themes. Originality/value: This study contributes a systematic literature review method by applying an online PFNET approach, provides a well-researched list of references for researchers conducting service quality research and highlights research gaps for researchers who plan to pursue service quality research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Accessibility studies have demonstrated how different areas within the same city enjoy variable amounts of accessibility to social infrastructure like schools and parks. Core areas of Indian cities generally enjoy good levels of accessibility while newly developing peripheral areas suffer most from the lack of adequate social infrastructure. Planning processes have failed to keep pace with market-led development. Sub-optimal levels of accessibility to social infrastructure can have negative implications on human development leading to increased marginalization of communities. This paper examines the accessibility to parks enjoyed by residents of Delhi’s Zone-E bordering Ghaziabad and Noida. It claims that the master plan mechanism in Delhi has failed to ensure equitable access to parks. More specifically, it argues that the master plan mechanism has failed to recognize that actual densities on ground are far higher than those used while planning for social infrastructure. Additionally, the presence of physical barriers like expressways exacerbates the lack of accessibility since they discourage crossing by pedestrians and cyclists. The paper concludes by suggesting ways to arrive at a more equitable distribution of social infrastructure through preparation of local accessibility plans using participatory methods. © Springer India 2017.},

To date, much of the empirical work on this topic is mainly spatial in nature despite recent developments that call for the inclusion of time use analyses in social exclusion research. In this paper we attempt to fill this gap by estimating activity and trip durations to determine whether poverty, old age, or being a single parent results in time use patterns indicative of exclusion. Given the importance of shopping and using services for social inclusion objectives, these activities are the focus of this investigation. In terms of methods, use of a multiple equation approach allows for the estimation of the daily duration of shopping activities and trips while simultaneously controlling for daily durations of four broad categories of activities as well as their associated travel times. The results indicate: that being a senior citizen increases travel durations while decreasing shopping activity durations; that coming from a low income household decreases shopping activity durations; and single-parent status does not impact shopping activity durations when holding income and other activity durations constant. These results highlight the feasibility and challenges of time-use and activity analysis in social exclusion research. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {We investigate whether increasing cycling activity affects the emergence of new local businesses. Historical amenity data from OpenStreetMap is used to quantify change in shop and sustenance amenity counts. We apply an instrumental variable framework to investigate a causal relationship and to account for endogeneity in the model. Measures of cycling infrastructure serve as instruments. The impact is evaluated on the level of 4835 Lower Super Output Areas in Greater London. Our results indicate that an increase in cycling trips significantly contributes to the emergence of new local shops and businesses. Limitations regarding data quality, zero-inflation and residual spatial autocorrelation are discussed. While our findings correspond to previous investigations stating positive economic effects of cycling, we advance research in the field by providing a new dataset of unprecedented high granularity and size. Furthermore, this is the first study in cycling research looking at business amenities as a measure of economic activity. The insights from our analysis can enhance understandings of how cycling affects the development of local urban economies and may thus be used to assess and evaluate transport policies and investments. Beyond this, our study highlights the value of open data in city research. Copyright: © 2018 Klemmer et al.

	abstract = {High Speed Rail's (HSR) main objective is to attract air passengers between big metropolitan areas however the main territorial implications in many cases occur not in these metropolitan areas but in the intermediate cities. These implications open up new spatial planning possibilities such as decentralization, new regional centres and urban renewal projects. This book presents the experience of 20 years of HSR in Spain including some explicit information, arguments and conclusions derived from HSR in other European Countries. It debates the HSR territorial implications at three scales: national, regional and local, thus being of interest for strategic debates at those scales, such as the decision of new national lines, the pros and cons of deviating the line to reach minor intermediate cities or the selection of precise locations for new stations and the development projects in their surroundings. Comparisons with the recent changes in accessibility, spatial distribution of population and activities, are made with mobility for working purposes and with the characteristics of the HSR passengers. This book also examines the actions, strategies and urban projects that medium size cities can use to make best use of HSR opportunities, synthesising the experience of HSR medium cities in Spain and Europe. The book's conclusions will be of interest, over and above scholars, to transport infrastructure decision makers, city and regional planners and managers, and transport companies. © José M. de Ureña 2012.

The proposed methodology is applied and validated in Cambrils municipality, in the central part of the Costa Daurada in Catalonia, a coastal destination characterised by the concentration of tourism flows during summer. The application of GIS spatial analysis tools allows for the development of a system of territorial indicators that spatially correlate the public transport network and the distribution of the population. The main novelty of our work is that this analysis not only includes the registered resident population, but also incorporates the population that temporarily inhabits the municipality (tourists). The results of the study firstly permit the detection of unequal spatial accessibility and coverage in terms of public transport in the municipality, with significant differences between central neighbourhoods and peripheral urban areas of lower population density. Secondly, they allow observation of how the degree of public transport coverage differs significantly in areas with a higher concentration of tourist accommodation establishments. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Accessible employment suited to residents’ needs is an important equity issue and social determinant of health and wellbeing, and a balanced jobs-housing ratio within a region has the potential to provide health benefits. This paper aims to provide evidence on the associations between employment and health, and the potential pathways, as well as identifying spatial indicators that can be used to measure urban employment, a construct of liveability. We used 2011 census data to create and test two area-level spatial measures of urban employment with geo-coded population health behaviour and outcome data (2011 VicHealth survey) in 5206 employed adults living in urban Victoria, Australia. Those living in areas with higher levels of local employment had reduced odds of a longer commute (OR 0.87). The odds of a longer commute time was also greater for those who lived in an area where more people commuted to work by private vehicle (OR 1.20), and less for those who lived in local areas where more people travelled to work by public transport (OR 0.85) or active travel (OR 0.80). The odds of reporting longer sitting times was less for those who lived in a local area where more people commuted to work by private vehicle (OR 0.65). Those who had a longer commute times, regardless of travel mode, had greater odds of reporting more sitting during a typical weekday (OR 1.67). In turn, those who spent more time sitting had significantly greater odds of reporting poorer self-rated health (OR 1.34). Such work provides evidence to policy-makers to help build the argument for which area-level attributes are needed to support urban employment across a region. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Accessibility is facilitated by well-organized transportation systems that move people efficiently, and it is improved as more activities are reachable to people given the means of available travel. As the current population ages, it will ultimately challenge those who manage transportation systems in their attempts to satisfy the older population's basic needs. Scanning the literature, accessibility has not been fully explored in relation to aging and older populations. We construct a systematic quantitative analysis of the older population's accessibility to potential activities. Given their residential patterns and the prevailing transportation system, we ask whether they have as much potential accessibility to activities as their younger counterparts. Our study area is a smaller metropolitan area in the state of Florida. Using highly disaggregate spatial data containing the locations of populations and possible activities, we implement accessibility models in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment, accounting for mode of transportation. Scenarios and activities analyzed are informed by a review of the broader literature as well as our own analysis of the 2009 National Household Travel Survey. We find that the potential accessibility of the aging population varies by activity type and differs with other age group cohorts. When we look in detail at subgroups within the aging population, the oldest group (those 85+) tends to have higher levels of accessibility. © 2015 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies.},

This exploratory and qualitative study provides a multi-perspective assessment of the usability, as well as of the environmental facilitators and obstacles to social participation in shopping malls. The results also suggest necessary improvements. We interviewed 15 persons with disabilities, 15 rehabilitation professionals and 9 shopkeepers. Participants viewed the mall as a multifunctional place for everyday use, but at times, also as a limiting place. Multiple facilitators and obstacles were identified; the most important were interaction with shopkeepers and the mall's design for mobility or wayfinding. All participants agreed shopkeeper training and an improved awareness of the needs of persons with disabilities would be beneficial. Multiple stakeholders' perceptions provide a basis for further investigation about needed changes and their potential for making malls more welcoming and inclusive to all. © 2014 Association ALTER.},

To empirically test the proposed model this study collected data from 318 individual customers of electronics and information technology brands with the help of self-administered questionnaire survey method. The study utilised Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique to statistically analyse measurement and structural models. The model fit indices indicated that proposed theoretical model is good fit with the data used in study. Confirmatory factor analysis depicted that the data has successfully fulfilled the requirements of reliability, convergent validity and discriminative validity. The results of structural model revealed that green brand image plays significant positive role in building green brand trust, green brand attachment and green brand commitment. Additionally, the results indicated that green brand trust partially mediates the relationship of green brand image with green brand attachment and green brand commitment. It is concluded that green brand image is a significant driver in relationship building process.

Is distance dead, have the laws of regional organization dissolved away in the age of Internet shopping? Following a discussion of some figures, trends and definitions relating to e-commerce, the paper develops a tentative theoretical framework for the study of this question. First, the fragmentation of activity hypothesis suggests that the activity of shopping can be decomposed into a large number of different sub-activities, some of which can better be carried out physically and others electronically from a variety of different locations. Next, noting that the sub-activity of paying for a purchase is the single most critical one for the survival of a local retail presence, a general game-theoretic model is outlined to help to estimate the relative amounts of physical vs. Internet shopping that would help to safeguard a healthy local retail presence. The paper concludes that e-commerce is not about to end the 'tyranny of the region'. Regional structure principles remain important, although many familiar analytic approaches may have to be rethought or extended. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.},

	abstract = {Location-allocation modelling studies, primarily applied to facility Location problems, have rapidly increased and extensively spanned a wide range of disciplines in the past three decades. In Japan, facility location models have attracted the attention of planning-oriented researchers from architecture, city engineering, operations research, and of a few geographers. This paper has three aims: first, to introduce location-allocation models to Japanese geographers; second, to review the development of new literature on representing decision-making behavior, uncertainty in the environment and the multi-objective formulation; and, third, to identify the tasks of models in chiefly geographical research. In general, location-allocation models are classified into three problems: the p-median problem which minimizes the aggregate distance or time from demand point i to facility j; the p-center problem which minimizes the maximum distance from i to j; the covering problem where coverage is required (the set covering problem) or optimized (the maximal covering location problem). These models on a network are formulated as a linear programming or a mixed-integer programming. Due to the computational complexity of these problems, several heuristic solution methods have been developed and demand data aggregation methods to eliminate errors in the aggregation process have been proposed. © 1994, The Human Geographical Society of Japan.

	abstract = {This chapter describes some public facility location (PFL) problems. PFL problems have been studied within several analytical traditions—for example, the general location theory, the theories of public goods and public choice, and the operations research tradition. The chapter focuses on the study of PFL-problems that are related to different aspects of these traditions. The perspective in this study is not intra-urban but regional. This is emphasized by a concentration on location problems in the agendas of the following type: (i) location among municipalities in a region and (ii) location among regions in a national (or multiregional) perspective. Taking a region as a reference area, the chapter identifies the coordination problem of a regional authority and the simultaneous game-like competition among each municipality of the region. Municipality refers to a community with a local government. A similar two-level decision problem is also identified for settings with a national authority and independent regional authorities. The chapter presents various types of PFL-problems and deals with the aggregation of demand and supply from the subregional to the regional level.},

Previous research on strategic alliances, both in the service and manufacturing sector, has mainly focused on issues relating to the organization. Consumer perceptions have generally been ignored-in view of the pivotal role of the consumer in service settings a surprising neglect. The paper focuses on the airline industry, an industry with a high service element, to illustrate how positive results eventuating for partners in a strategic alliance may cover slow shifts in consumer attitudes, and behavior. If not carefully monitored, these shifts may adversely affect performance measures of individual alliancepartners in the long-term. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Various studies have been conducted on accessibility in the field of geography. Diverse accessibility concepts were used in those studies and many methods for measurement have been developed. Improved models of existing accessibility continued to be contrived, which made accessibility concepts complex. This paper has two purposes. First, theauthor classifies the quantitative measurement methods for accessibility and points out the features and problems of each model. The second aim is to investigate the changes in accessibility studies with advances in geographical information systems (GIS). The themes of accessibility that have attracted the most attention are transportation, spatial equity in service, and living behavior of residents. Quantitative accessibility is composed of relative accessibility and integral accessibility, in particular the latter has been mainly used for a long time. It is considered that the most useful measures of accessibility are the gravity-model measure and cumulative-opportunity measure. However, it has been pointed out that these measures of integral accessibility include some problems. GIS provide very useful functions for measuring accessibility. One is a tool for determining the shortest path in a network, and the other is a tool for spatial analysis such as buffering and overlay. Due to the drastic reduction in the time required for measuring accessibility, the trend in accessibility studies has changed markedly. Precise studies using large amounts of data have increased, and new accessibility measures based on the concept of time geography have been established. In contrast with integral accessibility, "place accessibility," the new space-time measure, "individual accessibility," has been introduced. The latter enables to measure the accessibility by individuals. The space-time constraints in individual and multiple-stop trips are taken into consideration in the space-time measure, so that the problems of integral accessibility are overcome. However, the space-time measure has some problems not seen in integral accessibility. Further improvements will continue to be made, and analysts must choose which measure to use according to the purpose of analysis.},
